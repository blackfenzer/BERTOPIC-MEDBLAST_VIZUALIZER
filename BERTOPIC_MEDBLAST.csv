Recently, Major Adverse Kidney Events (MAKE) were introduced as important kidney endpoints. If these endpoints can be predicted, then it may help the physicians to identify high-risk patients and provide the opportunity to have targeted preventive therapy. The objective of this study was to create a simplified scoring system to predict MAKE within 28 days among AKI patients in ICU. Methods: This is a prospective web-based multicenter cohort study that was conducted in adults who were admitted to the ICU in 17 centers across Thailand from 2013 to 2015. A predicting score was derived from the regression equation with Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analysis to evaluate the diagnostic test and produce predictive models. Internal validation was obtained using the bootstrapping method. Results: From 5071 cases, 2856 (56%) had AKI. Among those with AKI, 1749 (61%) had MAKE. Among those that have MAKE, there were 1175 (41.4%) deaths, 414 (14.4%) were on dialysis and 1154 (40.7%) had non-recovery renal function. The simplified score points of low Glasgow coma scale was 3, tachypnea was 1, vasopressor use was 1, on mechanical ventilation was 2, oliguria was 2, serum creatinine rising ≥ 3 times was 5, high blood urea nitrogen was 3, low hematocrit was 2, and thrombocytopenia was 1. The area under ROC curve for optimism corrected performance was 0.80 (0.78, 0.81). When the cut-off value was 7, the sensitivity, specificity, positive likelihood ratio, and positive predictive values were 0.75, 0.76, 3.10, and 0.84, respectively. When the scoring system was calibrated, the α intercept and β slope were 1.001 and 0, respectively. Conclusions: SEA-MAKE scoring system is a new simplified clinical tool that can be used to predict major adverse kidney events in AKI patients. The simplicity of the scoring system is highly likely to be used in resource-limited settings. However, external validation is necessary before widespread use.', 'The effect of acid aging on the mechanical and tribological properties of coir–coconut husk-reinforced low-density polyethylene composites  2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.The present study investigates the physical, thermo-mechanical and tribological properties of coir–coconut husk particulate-reinforced polymer composites subjected to a corrosive environment. The composites were prepared by the conventional facile hot compression molding method. The composite was immersed in a strongly acidic environment of pH 2.2 for a period of 3, 6, and 9 days. X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis were used to elucidate the structure and morphology of the composites. The thermal analysis using differential scanning calorimetry, water absorption, hardness, coefficient of friction and wear rate was performed as per the ASTM standards to characterize the as-prepared and aged composites. The experimental test results revealed that with an increase in acid aging time, the acid aged samples lost surface matrix such that the fiber was seen on the surface. The effects of corrosion seemingly reduced the crystallinity of the acid aged samples allowing amorphous regions to be trapped within the crystals. Water absorption of the samples increased with aging time due to inherent voids in the specimens as weight gain values were 5.27, 16.80, 19.33 and 19.91%, respectively for control and acid aged samples. Hardness values initially decreased with immersion time and increased which was attributed to the crystallinity of the specimens and to some extent the elemental carbon present in the specimens before and after aging. The measured hardness values of the control and acid aged composites were 2.98, 7.27, 14.40 and 9.07 HV, respectively. From the thermal analysis, it was noticed that the glass transition temperature (Tg) of the polymer shifts to higher temperatures as the aging time in the acidic medium increased, which can be attributed to cross-linking of the polymer chains. The control specimen shows higher coefficient of friction (CoF) because they are more rigid than the acid aged samples, and hence under dry sliding can cause more friction leading to increased heat and CoF.', 'Predictors of treatment outcome in depression in later life: A systematic review and meta-analysis  2017 Elsevier B.V.Background Predictor analyses of late-life depression can be used to identify variables associated with outcomes of treatments, and hence ways of tailoring specific treatments to patients. The aim of this review was to systematically identify, review and meta-analyse predictors of outcomes of any type of treatment for late-life depression. Methods Pubmed, Embase, CINAHL, Web of Science and PsycINFO were searched for studies published up to December 2016. Primary and secondary studies reported treatment predictors from randomised controlled trials of any treatment for patients with major depressive disorder aged over 60 were included. Treatment outcomes included response, remission and change in depression score. Results Sixty-seven studies met the inclusion criteria. Of 65 identified statistically significant predictors, only 7 were reported in at least 3 studies. Of these, 5 were included in meta-analyses, and only 3 were statistically significant. Most studies were rated as being of moderate to strong quality and satisfied key quality criteria for predictor analyses. Limitations The searches were limited to randomised controlled trials and most of the included studies were secondary analyses. Conclusions Baseline depression severity, co-morbid anxiety, executive dysfunction, current episode duration, early improvement, physical illnesses and age were reported as statistically significant predictors of treatment outcomes. Only the first three were significant in meta-analyses. Subgroup analyses showed differences in predictor effect between biological and psychosocial treatment. However, high heterogeneity and small study numbers suggest a cautious interpretation of results. These predictors were associated with various mechanisms including brain pathophysiology, perceived social support and proposed distinct types of depressive disorder. Further investigation of the clinical utility of these predictors is suggested.']"

The final state consists of two b quark-antiquark pairs. The search is conducted in the region of phase space where one pair is highly Lorentz-boosted and is reconstructed as a single large-area jet, and the other pair is resolved and is reconstructed using two b-tagged jets. The results are obtained by combining this analysis with another from CMS looking for events with two large jets. Limits are set on the product of the cross sections and branching fractions for narrow bulk gravitons and radions in warped extradimensional models having a mass in the range 750-3000 GeV. The resulting observed and expected upper limits on the non-resonant Higgs boson pair production cross section correspond to 179 and 114 times the standard model value, respectively, at 95% confidence level.

The analysis uses LHC proton-proton collision data recorded with the CMS detector in 2016 at s = 13 TeV, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb−1. No significant excess is observed above the expected background. Model-independent upper limits at 95% confidence level are set on the product of the H± production cross section and branching fraction in two scenarios. For production in association with a top quark, limits of 21.3 to 0.007 pb are obtained for H± masses in the range of 0.2 to 3 TeV. Combining this with a search in leptonic final states results in improved limits of 9.25 to 0.005 pb. The complementary s-channel production of an H± is investigated in the mass range of 0.8 to 3 TeV and the corresponding upper limits are 4.5 to 0.023 pb. These results are interpreted using different minimal supersymmetric extensions of the standard model.

The search is performed using proton-proton collision data collected by the CMS experiment at the LHC at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb−1. Events are selected by the presence of a single isolated charged lepton (electron or muon) or an opposite-sign dilepton (electron or muon) pair, categorized according to the jet multiplicity and the number of jets identified as originating from b quarks. Multivariate analysis techniques are used to enhance the discrimination between signal and background in each category. The data are compatible with the standard model, and 95% confidence level upper limits of 9.6–0.01 pb are set on the charged Higgs boson production cross section times branching fraction to a top-bottom quark-antiquark pair, for charged Higgs boson mass hypotheses ranging from 200 GeV to 3 TeV.

However, the incidence and maternal/fetal outcomes of AF in pregnancy remain unclear. This study's aims were to investigate the pooled incidence of AF in pregnant women and to assess maternal/fetal outcomes of AF in pregnancy. Material and methods: A literature search for studies that reported incidence of AF in pregnancy, was conducted using MEDLINE, EMBASE and Cochrane Database from inception through May 2018. Pooled incidence with 95%CI were calculated using a random-effect model. The protocol for this meta-analysis is registered with PROSPERO (International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews; no. CRD42018095955). Results: We identified 7 cohort studies including 301,638 pregnancies. The pooled estimated incidence of AF in pregnancy among women with no known heart disease, and those with structural heart disease was 0.3% (95%CI: 0.01%–40.6%) and 2.2% (95%CI: 0.96%–5.01%), respectively. Among women with known AF, the pooled estimated incidence of recurrent AF in pregnancy was 39.2% (95%CI: 16.9%–67.2%). The pooled estimated incidence of pre-eclampsia and congestive heart failure among pregnant patients with AF was 4.1% (95%CI: 2.1%–7.8%) and 9.6% (95%CI: 5.7%–15.9%), respectively. The pooled estimated incidence of fetal events including premature birth, small for gestational age, respiratory distress syndrome, intraventricular hemorrhage, death was 26.6% (95%CI: 20.4%–34.0%). Conclusion: The overall estimated incidence of AF and recurrent AF during pregnancy is as high as 2.2% and 39.2%, respectively. AF during pregnancy may result in poor maternal and fetal outcomes."", 'Catheter ablation for atrial fibrillation in the elderly >75 years old: Systematic review and meta-analysis  2022 Wiley Periodicals LLC.Introduction: Atrial fibrillation (AF) ablation is increasingly performed worldwide. As comfort with AF ablation increases, the procedure is increasingly used in patients that are older and in those with more comorbidities. However, it is not well established whether AF ablation in the elderly, especially those >75 years old, has comparable safety and efficacy to younger populations. Objective: To compare the efficacy and safety profiles in patients older than 75 years undergoing AF ablation with younger patients. Methods: Databases from EMBASE, Medline, PubMed, and Cochrane, were searched from inception through September 2021. Studies that compared the success rates in AF catheter ablation and all complications rates between patients who were older vs under 75 years were included. Effect estimates from the individual studies were extracted and combined using random effect, generic inverse variance method of DerSimonian and Laird. Results: Twenty-seven observational studies were included in the analysis consisting of 363,542 patients who underwent AF ablation. Comparing patients older than 75 years old to younger patients, there was no difference in the success of ablation rates between elderly and younger patients (pooled OR 0.85: 95% CI:0.69–1.05, p =.131). On the other hand, AF ablation in the elderly was associated with higher complication rates (pooled OR 1.42: 95% CI:1.21–1.68, p <.001). Conclusion: As AF ablation is expanded to elderly populations, our study found that AF ablation success rates were similar in both elderly and younger patients. However, older patients experience higher rates of complications that should be considered when offering the procedure and as a means to improve outcomes with future innovations.', ""Atrial fibrillation following heart transplantation: A systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies  2018 Chinese Cochrane Center, West China Hospital of Sichuan University and John Wiley & Sons Australia, LtdObjective: Previous studies have suggested a high incidence of atrial fibrillation (AF) in heart transplant recipients. However, incidence trends of AF in heart transplant recipients remain unclear. The study's aims were (1) to investigate the pooled incidence/incidence trends of AF following heart transplantation and (2) to assess the mortality risk of heart transplant recipients with AF. Methods: A literature search for studies that reported the incidence of AF following heart transplantation was conducted using MEDLINE, EMBASE, and The Cochrane Database from inception through March 2018. Pooled incidence and odds ratios (OR) with 95%CI were calculated using a random-effects model. Results: Eighteen studies (2 cohorts from clinical trials and 16 cohort studies) with 5393 heart transplant recipients were enrolled. The pooled estimated incidence of AF in heart transplant was 10.1% (95%CI: 7.6%-13.2%). Meta-analysis based on the type of anastomotic technique demonstrated a pooled estimated incidence of AF following heart transplantation of 18.7% (95%CI: 10.3%-31.5%) and 11.1% (95%CI: 6.5%-18.4%) by biatrial and bicaval techniques, respectively. There was a significant association between AF following a heart transplant and increased mortality risk with a pooled OR of 2.86 (95%CI: 2.08-3.93). Meta-regression analyses showed no significant correlations between the year of study and incidence of AF (P = 0.47) or mortality risk of AF after heart transplantation (P = 0.99). Conclusions: The overall estimated incidence of AF following heart transplantation is 10.1%. There is a significant association between AF and increased mortality after transplantation. Furthermore, incidence and mortality risk of AF following heart transplant does not seem to decrease over time.""]"

The study has employed the survey-based method to answer the research questions as manufacturing managers are surveyed as ultimately, manufacturing managers are responsible for the performance of the organizations for which they work. The SEM-PLS is used to analyze the data collected from the manufacturing managers of Thai chemical firms. The literature provides considerable empirical evidence regarding the linkage of supply chain success with the ERP information mechanism, which helps to share information between the partnering firms. The findings of the study have provided support to the hypotheses results. The consideration of four green constructs in the model explains that cooperation causes largest influence on the environmental performance, next comes the investment recovery and eco-design. However, no significant association was found between cooperation with customers and economic or environmental performance particularly in case of greater customer pressure for adopting environment friendly practices in Thailand.', 'Exploring the nexus between the organizational entrepreneurship, supply chain integration and the performance outcomes of Thai textile industry  2019, ExcelingTech Pub, UK.With the increase of importance for collaboration, intelligence, operational integration with partners in supply chain and inter-organizational partnership, there has been change in the role of supply managers in improving corporate performance. This is reflected in the research related to firms and entrepreneurial settings. The mechanism identified in previous research studies along with the entrepreneurial skills and role of supply management have been explored in this research study. The integration of firm with its suppliers is contributed by entrepreneurial behavior as reflected by the results, which are in line with theoretical framework. This improves the performance of firm. Managers, who aim at improving performance, can achieve high performance through changes in culture and recruitment of management supply function to an entrepreneurial orientation.

Finally, the study has examined the moderating roe of organizational innovation climate and strategic relationship. The knowledge-based view and the social capital theory are used to develop the conceptual model. This idea has been extended in this research by analyzing the way in which it happens. For instance, it has been argued that there is a need for a suitable internal environment for innovation that can improve the chain of innovation linking innovativeness of partners in the supply chain with innovation strategy of the focal firm. In the next step, the right external climate can be set by establishing a strategic relation with partners in the supply chain to get innovative ideas. Lack of a cooperative environment cannot result in effective knowledge sharing with the partners in the network.

The data on corporate culture of innovation are based on a textual analysis of earnings conference calls and represent a unique approach to capturing corporate culture. Design/methodology/approach: In addition to the standard regression analysis, the authors also perform several sophisticated robustness checks, such as propensity score matching, entropy balancing, an instrumental-variable analysis, Oster’s (2019) method for testing coefficient stability, GMM dynamic panel data analysis and Lewbel’s (2012) heteroscedastic identification. Findings: Corroborating the prediction of the resource dependence theory, the study results show that larger boards promote an innovative culture more effectively. A larger board with more directors provides the firm with additional resources, expertise and abilities, enabling it to develop an innovative culture more successfully. Originality/value: This study is the first to examine the effect of board size on innovation using data on corporate culture generated by sophisticated computer algorithms. The authors advance the literature both in corporate governance and corporate innovation.', ""Corporate Culture, Innovation, and Female Board Representation: Evidence from Earnings Conference Calls  2022 World Scientific Publishing Company.Exploiting a novel measure of corporate culture based on cutting-edge machine learning algorithms, we examine how female board representation influences a culture of innovation, and also whether female directors spur innovation culture in the presence of an active takeover market. Our results show that higher board gender diversity improves a corporate innovation culture considerably. Specifically, a rise in female board representation by one standard deviation improves an innovative culture by 4.37%. The findings corroborate the argument that female directors infuse the firm with new ideas and different perspectives, thereby enhancing an innovative culture. Furthermore, we also show that female board representation's interaction with the takeover market, which is a crucial external governance mechanism, spurs a corporate innovation culture as well. This implies that board gender diversity substantially softens the negative effect of hostile takeover threats on corporate innovation. Our study is the first to link board gender diversity to a culture of innovation and show the interaction effect with takeover threats."", 'Does board gender diversity matter? Evidence from hostile takeover vulnerability  2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.Purpose: Theory suggests that the market for corporate control, which constitutes an important external governance mechanism, may substitute for internal governance. Consistent with this notion, using a novel measure of takeover vulnerability primarily based on state legislation, this paper aims to investigate the effect of the takeover market on board characteristics with special emphasis on board gender diversity. Design/methodology/approach: This paper exploits a novel measure of takeover vulnerability based on state legislation. This novel measure is likely exogenous as the legislation was imposed from outside the firm. By using an exogenous measure, the analysis is less vulnerable to endogeneity and is thus more likely to show a causal effect. Findings: The results show that a more active takeover market leads to lower board gender diversity. Specifically, a rise in takeover vulnerability by one standard deviation results in a decline in board gender diversity by 10.01%. Moreover, stronger takeover market susceptibility also brings about larger board size and less board independence, corroborating the substitution effect. Additional analysis confirms the results, including propensity score matching, generalized method of moments dynamic panel data analysis and instrumental variable analysis. Originality/value: The study is the first to explore the effect of the takeover market on board gender diversity. Unlike most of the previous research in this area, which suffers from endogeneity, this paper uses a novel measure of takeover vulnerability that is probably exogenous. The results are thus much more likely to demonstrate causality.']"

Design: Clinical trial. Participants: Glaucoma patients who are recalcitrant to maximum tolerated medical therapy and require tube shunt surgery. Methods: Interventional cohort study involving consecutive PGIs implanted at 6 international centers between December 1, 2017, and December 1, 2018. All the participants were followed up for 1 year after surgery. Main Outcome Measures: The primary outcome measure was failure, defined prospectively as intraocular pressure (IOP) of more than 21 mmHg or less than 20% reduction from the preoperative baseline on 2 consecutive visits, 3 months or more after surgery; persistent late hypotony, defined as IOP of less than 6 mmHg on 2 consecutive visits after 3 months; additional glaucoma surgery; loss of light perception vision; or removal of the implant for any reason. Results: Of 82 patients enrolled, 74 (74 eyes) completed 12 months of follow-up. The mean age ± standard deviation at enrollment was 62.3±14.7 years, 73.0% were men, and 36.5% had secondary glaucoma. One year after surgery, 4 patients (5.4%) fulfilled the surgical criteria for failure, 68.9% (51/74 eyes) were deemed complete successes, and 93.2% (69/74 eyes) were considered qualified successes. Compared with the medicated preoperative IOP (23.1±8.2 mmHg), the postoperative IOPs at 6 and 12 months were 13.8±4.0 mmHg and 13.2±3.3 mmHg, respectively (P < 0.001).

Design: Prospective, longitudinal cohort study. Participants: One hundred twenty-four eyes of 124 patients with open-angle glaucoma. Methods: Over a 5-year period, 124 patients with open-angle glaucoma underwent yearly DP, VF testing, SD OCT RNFL thickness scans, and optic nerve volume scans (Spectralis; Heidelberg Engineering), all performed on the same day. From high-density optic nerve volume scans, custom-built software calculated the minimum distance band (MDB) thickness, a 3D neuroretinal rim parameter. Patients were classified as glaucoma progressors or nonglaucoma progressors using event-based analysis. Progression by DP and VF testing occurred when 3 masked glaucoma specialists unanimously concurred. Progression by RNFL and MDB thickness occurred if change of more than test–retest variability was observed. Kaplan-Meier curves were constructed to analyze time-to-progression data. Kappa Coefficients were used to measure agreement of progressing eyes among methods. Main Outcome Measures: Time to glaucoma progression among all 4 methods. Results: Global MDB thickness detected glaucoma progression in the highest percentage of eyes (52.4%) compared with DP (16.1%; P < 0.001) and global RNFL thickness (15.3%; P < 0.001). Global MDB thickness detected glaucoma progression earlier than either DP (23 months vs. 44 months; P < 0.001) or global RNFL thickness (23 months vs. 33 months; P < 0.001). Among MDB progressing eyes, 46.2% were confirmed simultaneously or later by other conventional methods. Agreement of glaucoma-progressing eyes for all 4 methods in paired fashion were slight to fair (κ = 0.095–0.300).

All rights reserved.Précis:This retrospective study found that combined phacoemulsification and endocyclophotocoagulation reduced intraocular pressure (IOP) to a greater degree in angle-closure glaucoma versus open-angle glaucoma and was effective for all stages of glaucoma.Purpose:Endocyclophotocoagulation (ECP) laser treatment of the ciliary processes is believed to decrease IOP by reducing aqueous production. Anecdotal experience in angle-closure glaucoma suggests that it may also lower IOP by opening the drainage angle to promote aqueous outflow. This study sought to evaluate combined phacoemulsification and ECP (phaco/ECP) in eyes with different types and stages of glaucoma.Patients and Methods:A Retrospective chart review of eyes that underwent phaco/ECP between October 2010 and December 2016 at one institution was conducted.Results:In 63 eyes of 63 patients with an average of 3.0±1.7 years of follow-up, the 22 eyes with chronic angle-closure glaucoma (CACG) had greater IOP reduction and medication reduction than the 41 eyes with primary open-angle glaucoma at both 1 year (6.4 vs. 2.1 mm Hg, P=0.01; 0.9 vs. 0.2 medications, P=0.04) and final follow-up (6.2 vs. 2.4 mm Hg, P=0.02; 0.9 vs. 0.3 medications, P=0.05). There was no difference in IOP reduction or medication reduction for eyes with mild, moderate, or advanced glaucoma at both 1 year (3.5, 3.9, 0.5 mm Hg, respectively, P=0.18; 0.3, 0.6, 0.4 medications, P=0.58) and final follow-up (3.3, 4.8, 0.7 mm Hg, P=0.11; 0.1, 0.8, 0.4 medications, P=0.14).Conclusions:Eyes with CACG were more responsive to phaco/ECP in terms of IOP and medication reduction compared with eyes with primary open-angle glaucoma. This finding could be partially or entirely due to concurrent cataract extraction and greater CACG preoperative IOP. Phaco/ECP was effective in all stages of glaucoma.']"

Journal of the International AIDS Society published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd on behalf of the International AIDS Society.INTRODUCTION: Data on HIV treatment outcomes in people who inject drugs (PWID) in the Asia-Pacific are sparse despite the high burden of drug use. We assessed immunological and virological responses, AIDS-defining events and mortality among PWID receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART). METHODS: We investigated HIV treatment outcomes among people who acquired HIV via injecting drug use in the TREAT Asia HIV Observational Database (TAHOD) between January 2003 and March 2019. Trends in CD4 count and viral suppression (VS, HIV viral load <1000 copies/mL) were assessed. Factors associated with mean CD4 changes were analysed using repeated measures linear regression, and combined AIDS event and mortality were analysed using survival analysis. RESULTS: Of 622 PWID from 12 countries in the Asia-Pacific, 93% were male and the median age at ART initiation was 31 years (IQR, 28 to 34). The median pre-ART CD4 count was 71 cells/µL. CD4 counts increased over time, with a mean difference of 401 (95% CI, 372 to 457) cells/µL at year-10 (n = 78). Higher follow-up HIV viral load and pre-ART CD4 counts were associated with smaller increases in CD4 counts. Among 361 PWID with ≥1 viral load after six months on ART, proportions with VS were 82%, 88% and 93% at 2-, 5- and 10-years following ART initiation. There were 52 new AIDS-defining events and 50 deaths during 3347 person-years of follow-up (PYS) (incidence 3.05/100 PYS, 95% CI, 2.51 to 3.70). Previous AIDS or TB diagnosis, lower current CD4 count and adherence <95% were associated with combined new AIDS-defining event and death. CONCLUSIONS: Despite improved outcomes over time, our findings highlight the need for rapid ART initiation and adherence support among PWID within Asian settings.', 'Rapid antiretroviral initiation among Thai youth living with HIV in the National AIDS programme in the era of treatment at any CD4 cell count: a national registry database study  2020 The Authors. Journal of the International AIDS Society published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd on behalf of the International AIDS Society.Introduction: The process indicators of ending the HIV epidemic include 90% of people living with HIV receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART). The population of youth, however, has less access to healthcare. We assessed ART initiation and attrition outcomes of the HIV continuum from HIV diagnosis to ART initiation in youth living with HIV (YLHIV) and factors associated with ART initiation. Methods: We studied YLHIV aged 15 to 24 years who were registered on the National AIDS Program (NAP) from January 2008 to May 2019. The study period was divided into 2008 to 2013 (initiated ART by CD4-guided criteria) and 2014 to 2018 (initiate ART at any CD4). Date of registration was used as a surrogate for the diagnosis date and defined as the baseline. The database included ART prescription and laboratory results, and the vital status was linked daily with the National Death Registry. Competing risk methods were used to assess factors associated with accessing ART, with loss to follow-up (LTFU) and death considered as competing events. Logistic regression was used to assess factors associated with rapid ART initiation, defined as initiation ≤1 month after registration. Results: Overall, 51,607 youth registered on the NAP (42% between 2008 and 2013). Median age was 21 (IQR 20 to 23) years; 64% were male. Overall ART initiation was 80% in the first period and 83% in the second. The ART initiation rate was higher among YLHIV aged 15 to 19 years (86%) than 20 to 24 years (82%) (p < 0.001) in the second period. The proportion of youth starting rapid ART increased significantly from 27% to 52% between the two periods (p < 0.001). Factors associated with ART initiation were age 15 to 19 years (aSHR 1.09, 95% CI 1.06 to 1.11), female (aSHR 1.26, 95% CI 1.23 to 1.29) and registration year 2014 to 2018 (aSHR 1.73, 95% CI 1.69 to 1.76). The cumulative incidence of LTFU/death prior to ART initiation at 12 months was 3.8% (95% CI 3.6% to 4.1%) in the first period and 1.9% (95% CI 1.8% to 2.1%) in the second period. Conclusions: In the era of universal treatment of all at any CD4 level, 83% of YLHIV registered on the Thai National AIDS Program initiated ART. The majority initiated within one month of registration.', 'Leveraging early HIV diagnosis and treatment in Thailand to conduct HIV cure research  2019 The Author(s).Thailand has the highest prevalence of HIV among countries in Asia but has also been a pioneer in HIV prevention and treatment efforts in the region, reducing the incidence of new infections significantly over the last two decades. Building upon this remarkable history, Thailand has set an ambitious goal to stop the AIDS epidemic in the country by 2030. A key component of the strategy to achieve this goal includes scale-up of HIV screening programs to facilitate early HIV diagnosis and investment in mechanisms to support immediate initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART). Initiation of ART during early or acute HIV infection not only reduces viremia, thereby halting onward transmission of HIV, but also may facilitate HIV remission by reducing the size of the latent HIV reservoir and preserving immune function. In Thailand, many efforts have been made to reduce the time from HIV infection to diagnosis and from diagnosis to treatment, especially among men who have sex with men and transgender women. Successfully identifying and initiating ART in individuals with acute HIV infection has been leveraged to conduct groundbreaking studies of novel strategies to achieve HIV remission, including studies of broadly-neutralizing HIV-specific monoclonal antibodies and candidate therapeutic vaccines. These efforts have mostly been deployed in Bangkok and future efforts should include other urban and more rural areas. Continued progress in HIV prevention, screening, and treatment will position Thailand to substantially limit new infections and may pave the way for an HIV cure.']"

This study aimed to evaluate the anticancer activity and related mechanisms of 4,5,4′-trihydroxy-3,3′-dimethoxybibenzyl (TDB), a bibenzyl extracted from Dendrobium ellipsophyllum Tang and Wang, in human lung cancer cells. Cytotoxicity of TDB (0–300 µM) in different types of human lung cancer cells (H460, H292 and H23) and human dermal papilla cells (DPCs) was evaluated via MTT viability assay. Selective anticancer activity of TDB against human lung cancer cells was demonstrated with a high IC50 (approximately > 300 µM) in DPCs, while IC50 in human lung cancer H460, H292 and H23 cells was approximately 100 ± 5.18, 100 ± 8.73 and 188.89 ± 8.30 µM, respectively. After treatment with 50 µM of TDB for 24 h, flow cytometry analysis revealed the significant increase of early and late apoptosis with absence of necrosis cell death in human lung cancer cells. The up-regulation of p53, a tumor-suppressor protein, was elucidated in human lung cancer cells treated with 10–50 µM of TDB. Alteration to down-stream signaling of p53 including activation of pro-apoptosis protein (Bcl-2-associated X protein; Bax), reduction of anti-apoptosis (B cell lymphoma 2; Bcl-2 and myeloid cell leukemia 1; Mcl-1) and suppression on protein kinase B (Akt) survival pathway were notified in TDB-treated lung cancer cells. The information obtained from this study strengthens the potential development of TDB as an anticancer compound with a favorable human safety profile and high efficacy.', 'Novel Synthetic Derivative of Renieramycin T Right-Half Analog Induces Apoptosis and Inhibits Cancer Stem Cells via Targeting the Akt Signal in Lung Cancer Cells  2023 by the authors.Akt is a key regulatory protein of cancer stem cells (CSCs) and is responsible for cancer aggressiveness and metastasis. Targeting Akt is beneficial for the development of cancer drugs. renieramycin T (RT) has been reported to have Mcl-1 targeting activity, and the study of the structure-activity relationships (SARs) demonstrated that cyanide and the benzene ring are essential for its effects. In this study, novel derivatives of the RT right-half analog with cyanide and the modified ring were synthesized to further investigate the SARs for improving the anticancer effects of RT analogs and evaluate CSC-suppressing activity through Akt inhibition. Among the five derivatives, a compound with a substituted thiazole structure (DH_25) exerts the most potent anticancer activity in lung cancer cells. It has the ability to induce apoptosis, which is accompanied by an increase in PARP cleavage, a decrease in Bcl-2, and a diminishment of Mcl-1, suggesting that residual Mcl-1 inhibitory effects exist even after modifying the benzene ring to thiazole. Furthermore, DH_25 is found to induce CSC death, as well as a decrease in CSC marker CD133, CSC transcription factor Nanog, and CSC-related oncoprotein c-Myc. Notably, an upstream member of these proteins, Akt and p-Akt, are also downregulated, indicating that Akt can be a potential target of action. Computational molecular docking showing a high-affinity interaction between DH_25 and an Akt at the allosteric binding site supports that DH_25 can bind and inhibit Akt. This study has revealed a novel SAR and CSC inhibitory effect of DH_25 via Akt inhibition, which may encourage further development of RT compounds for cancer therapy.', 'Lung cancer stem cells and cancer stem cell-targeting natural compounds  2018 International Institute of Anticancer Research. All rights reserved.The novel information regarding molecular and translational research have created a paradigm shift in the understanding of lung cancer biology, revealing the more precise target for anti-cancer drug discovery. Lung cancer is a leading cause of cancer death worldwide accounting for approximately 1 in 5 of all cancer-related deaths. The most important causes of death in such a cancer involves the treatment failure as well as the spreading of cancer cells to distant sites which the cancer stem cell (CSC) within the tumor is accepted as a key driver. CSC is a rare special population of cancer cells exhibiting high tumorigenic properties together with self-renewal and differentiation capability. CSC is not only linked with high tumor-initiating activity, but is also implicated in chemotherapeutic resistance, metastasis, epithelial to mesenchymal transition, and recurrence. Thereafter, novel therapeutic strategies targeting these CSCs are considered in order to improve long-term clinical outcome. Here, we provide sufficient data regarding the biology of CSC in lung cancer, known CSC markers and cellular signals, and promising compounds targeting the stem cell signals in lung cancer that may benefit the development of novel anti-cancer treatment.']"

The current work employed a reducing agent derived from turmeric extract to design an environmentally friendly and cost-effective plant-mediated method for producing silver-doped titanium dioxide (Ag-TiO2) for the photodegradation of methylene blue (MB). The green synthesis of Ag-TiO2 was carried out utilizing a dry and wet ball milling sol-gel method with turmeric extract. The effect of varying Ag concentrations in Ag-TiO2 on MB degradation was investigated. According to our findings, the optimal amount of Ag on TiO2 modification resulted in an increase in surface area, an improvement in visible light absorption, and a decrease in the TiO2 bandgap. X-ray absorption spectroscopy results showed the presence of Ag+ in the TiO2 structure, indicating Ag substitution and oxygen vacancy formation in TiO2. Ag NPs could considerably increase the electron–hole separation and enhance the photocatalytic efficiency of the Ag-TiO2. The 3 %Ag-TiO2 provided the highest photocatalytic activity for 80 % MB degradation under visible light for 9 h. The method presented here leads to a straightforward and environmentally benign route to make visible-light-active Ag-TiO2 nanoparticles and can be used for treatment of wastewater.', 'Facile synthesis of heterostructured g-C3N4/Ag -TiO2 photocatalysts with enhanced visible-light photocatalytic performance  2022. Journal of Metals, Materials and Minerals. All Rights Reserved.In this study, the g-C3N4/Ag-TiO2 composite photocatalysts were prepared to enhance the efficient utilization of solar energy. The g-C3N4 was synthesized by facile heat treatment of urea at 600°C for 4 h, and 0.05 wt% to 3 wt% Ag-TiO2 were obtained through the chemical reduction method. The composite photocatalysts were prepared by mixing the g-C3N4 and Ag-TiO2 with a weight ratio of 50:50 at room temperature. The photocatalytic efficiency was carried out by using 0.05 g of photocatalysts with 10 mg·L-1 of rhodamine B 120 mL under 60 min of visible light irradiation. The experimental results indicated that a sample with 0.1 wt% Ag-TiO2 could degrade rhodamine B up to 21.21%. The g-C3N4/(0.1 wt% Ag-TiO2) and g-C3N4 showed rhodamine B degradation efficiency up to 100%, which was 10.4 times and 4.7 times of pure TiO2 and 0.1 wt% Ag-TiO2, respectively. It can be suggested that the Ag deposited on TiO2 played an important role in the absorption capability under the visible light through the surface plasmon resonance effect. In addition, heterojunction between g-C3N4 and TiO2 could reduce the recombination of electron-hole pairs.', 'Investigation of the Ag species and synergy of Ag-TiO2 and g-C3N4 for the enhancement of photocatalytic activity under UV–Visible light irradiation  2021 Elsevier B.V.Herein, UV–visible light-responsive g-C3N4/Ag-TiO2 photocatalysts were successfully synthesized. The Ag species in the composites before and after photocatalysis were investigated by X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The Ag species in the Ag-TiO2 were all metallic Ag, while a combination of metallic Ag and Ag+ attributed to Ag2O was found in the composites. In addition, the change of Ag0/Ag+ oxidation after photocatalysis was conspicuously explored. The composite with optimal ratios of g-C3N4 to Ag-TiO2 at 2 to 1 (2CN:1ST) exhibited photocatalytic efficiencies for the degradation of rhodamine B (RhB, cationic dye) and methyl orange (MO, anionic dye) of 95.01 % and 98.13 % and 72.92 % and 92.82 % under UV and visible light irradiation, respectively. The results suggested that Ag-TiO2 is a predominantly UV-responsive photocatalyst, whereas g-C3N4 can effectively promote photocatalytic degradation under visible light irradiation. Therefore, the synergy of the synthesized g-C3N4 and Ag-TiO2 photocatalysts results in high-performance cationic and anionic dye degradation under both UV and visible light irradiation. In addition, the ability of Ag0/Ag+ to switch oxidation states under irradiation is advantageous to the suppression of recombination.']"

The aim of this narrative review is to review the phenomenological similarities and dissimilarities and the shared pathways between GAD and mood disorders. We searched PubMed, Scopus, and Google Scholar for articles published in English from 1980 to present. GAD and mood disorders, either MDD or BD, show some phenomenological overlaps and a high degree of comorbidity, especially between GAD and MDD. Both GAD and mood disorders are also frequently comorbid with other anxiety disorders, substance use disorders and medical conditions, including car-dio-vascular disorder (CVD). Mood disorders have a worse prognosis when GAD is present. GAD and mood disorders are associated with female sex and may partly share genetic variants of risk. Moreover, both GAD and mood disorders frequently share similar environmental risks factors including Early Life Time Trauma (ELT) and Psychological Stressors in Adulthood (PSA). Increased nitro-oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation coupled to lowered lipid-associated antioxidant defenses are evident in GAD, MDD and type I bipolar patients. Patients with comorbid GAD and MDD show significantly higher nitro-oxidative biomarkers as compared with patients presenting with either GAD or MDD as well as patients with BD with or without co-occurring GAD. Activated immune-inflammatory processes characterized by increased levels of CRP and pro-inflammatory cytokines are other shared pathways that underpin GAD and mood disorders. Moreover, these pathways may explain comorbidities with medical disorders including CVD. Aberrations in HPA-axis, GABA and glutamate neurotransmission, NMDA and mu opioid-receptors and neuroimaging fields have yielded more inconsistent findings. In conclusion, here we propose a new model explaining GAD and the comorbidity between GAD and mood disorders. Common triggers such as ELT/PSA may underpin GAD and its comorbidity with mood disorders via activated neuro-oxidative, neuro-nitrosative and neuro-immune pathways.', 'Differences in the immune-inflammatory profiles of unipolar and bipolar depression  2019 Elsevier B.V.Background: Major depressive disorder (MDD) and bipolar depression (BD) both share increased immune-inflammatory activation. However, there are unclear patterns of differences in peripheral immune profiles between them. Methods: We examined such differences in 245 MDD and 59 BD patients, recruited in the same center, who were in an acute depressive episode of moderate severity. Hierarchical binary logistic regression analyses and generalized linear models were used to compare levels of plasma biomarkers between groups and to predict dichotomous classification. Results: Interleukin (IL)-1β, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, soluble TNF receptor (sTNFR)1, IL-12 and IL-10 were significantly higher in MDD than in BD, whereas IL-6, sTNFR2, IL-18, IL-33, ST2 (IL1R Like 1) and KLOTHO were significantly higher in BD than in MDD. Moreover, logistic regression analyses correctly classified BD and MDD patients with 98.1% accuracy, using a combination of IL-6, IL-8, ST2, sTNFR2 (directly associated with BD) and IL-12 and TNF-α (directly associated with MDD). Patients with MDD with melancholic features showed higher IL-1β levels than those without melancholia. The sTNFR1 / sTNFR2 ratio significantly predicted MDD and state and trait anxiety and negative affect. Results remained significant after covariate adjustment, including drug use. Limitations: Cross-sectional study. Lack of control comparison group. Differences in exposure to medications among participants. Conclusions: Differences in immune profiles between BD and MDD patients exist, especially for the compensatory immune-regulatory system (CIRS): increased IL-10 is the primary immune-regulatory mechanism in MDD, while increased sTNFR2 and KLOTHO are the primary regulatory mechanisms in BD.', 'The Compensatory Immune-Regulatory Reflex System (CIRS) in Depression and Bipolar Disorder  2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.Here, we review a novel concept namely the compensatory immune-regulatory reflex system (CIRS) as applied to the pathophysiology of major depressive disorder (MDD) and bipolar disorder (BD). There is evidence that a substantial subset of individuals with MDD and BD exhibit an activation of the immune-inflammatory response system (IRS), as indicated by an increased production of macrophagic M1 and T helper (Th)-1 pro-inflammatory cytokines, interleukin (IL)-6 trans-signaling, positive acute phase proteins (APPs), and complement factors. These immune aberrations appear to be evident during the course of major affective episodes of either depressive or (hypo) manic polarity. Here, we review (a) the current state of the art of CIRS functions in both mood disorders and (b) the possible role of CIRS-related biomarkers for the understanding of affective disorders within the framework of precision psychiatry that could also provide novel drug targets for both MDD and BD. CIRS-related abnormalities in mood disorders include elevated Th-2 and T regulatory (Treg) activities with increased IL-4 and IL-10 production, classical IL-6 signaling, increased levels of sIL-1R antagonist (sIL-1RA), soluble IL-2 (sIL-2R) and tumor necrosis factor–α- receptors, and positive APPs, including haptoglobin, hemopexin, α1-acid glycoprotein, α1-antitrypsin, and ceruloplasmin. It is concluded that CIRS is involved in MDD and BD by regulating the primary immune-inflammatory response, thereby contributing to spontaneous and antidepressant-promoted recovery from the acute phase of illness. Signs of activated IRS and CIRS pathways are observed in the remitted phases of both disorders indicating that there is no return to the original homeostasis after an acute episode, while later episodes of mood disorders are characterized by sensitized IRS and CIRS responses. New z-unit weighted composite biomarker scores are proposed, which reflect different aspects of IRS versus CIRS activation and may be used to estimate different IRS/CIRS activity ratios in mood and other neuroimmune disorders.']"

PCC 6803. The biomass and lipid contents were evaluated in both the wild type and the engineered strains after copper treatment. The maximum lipid production of 0.981 g/L with the productivity of 81.75 mg/L/d was obtained from the copper treated ΔglgC + A-OX strain, which showed a 3.3-fold increase compared to the untreated wild type with satisfactory biodiesel properties. After copper treatment the knockout strain improved the unsaturated fatty acids level contributing to the increase of the saturated and mono-unsaturated ratio with improvement of the fuel quality. Copper induced oxidative stress also improved the photosynthetic pigments in engineered strains leading to increased tolerance against oxidative stress in the engineered strains.

PCC 6803  2023 Elsevier B.V.Under an adequate nitrate supply (BG11), cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 has high protein content but a low storage of glycogen and poly(3-hydroxybutyrate) (PHB). In contrast, when deprived of nitrogen (–N), protein synthesis was repressed and the accumulation of glycogen and PHB was remarkably increased. The repressed protein synthesis caused by sulfur deprivation or treatment with chloramphenicol was also found to slightly enhance PHB accumulation in Synechocystis. Thus, the repressed protein synthesis is associated with the increased PHB and glycogen storage. Here, we examined two other antibiotics that inhibit protein synthesis, erythromycin (EM) and streptomycin (SM) for their effect on the accumulation of PHB and glycogen in Synechocystis. Under –N cultivation, 10 μM EM treatment significantly increased the PHB level to 18 % (w/w cell dry weight [DW]) compared to 3 % (w/w DW) in the untreated cells; however, SM treatment did not increase the PHB level. Under BG11 cultivation, exposure to 0.7 μM SM and 5 μM EM enhanced glycogen accumulation up to 15 % and 41 % (w/w DW) respectively, compared to only 7 % (w/w DW) in the untreated cells. The EM treatment also remarkably reduced the total protein and phycobiliprotein contents. Results from metabolomic analysis suggested that EM treatment caused protein degradation into amino acids, some of which were metabolized into substrates that can be used for PHB and glycogen synthesis. This was substantiated by the result showing that EM treated cells had significantly increased levels of both the PHB-synthesizing substrates (acetyl-CoA, acetoacetyl-CoA, and 3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA) when cultured under –N, and the glycogen-synthesizing substrates (fructose-1,6-BP, fructose-6-P, glucose-6-P, glucose-1-P, and ADP-glucose) when cultured in BG11.

PCC 6803 produced a high biomass yield but with a low storage level of glycogen and poly(3-hydroxybutyrate) (PHB). In contrast, deprivation of N or P stimulated accumulation of glycogen and PHB, but reduced biomass yield. In addition, deprivation of N or P had no apparent effect on total lipid accumulation. Here, we examined how partial supply of N or P has effects on the biomass yield and production of glycogen, PHB, and lipids. The N or P supply in the culture media was orderly decreased from 100% (set according to the standard BG11 medium) to 50, 35, 20, 10, and 0%. A 100% supply of both N and P produced biomass of up to 1.4 g L−1, while a 35–50% N supply slightly reduced the biomass to 1.2–1.3 g L−1, and no apparent change in the biomass was detected under a 20–50% P supply. A maximum glycogen accumulation of 51.8% (w/w dry weight; DW) was obtained under 20% P supply, while the maximum PHB storage of 6.3% (w/w DW) was obtained with 10% P supply. Lipid accumulation peaked at 12.7% (w/w DW) under 0% P supply. The maximal co-production of these three bioproducts was obtained under 20% P supply at 765 mg L−1 which is the sum of 72 mg L−1 PHB (corresponding to 5.1% w/w DW PHB), 618 mg L−1 glycogen (43.8% w/w DW glycogen), and 75 mg L−1 lipid (5.3% w/w DW lipid) from the total biomass production of 1.4 g L−1. The glycogen production (618 mg L−1) was higher than those previously reported for Synechocystis. The results indicated that a proper adjustment of initial N and P supplies in the culture is crucial for maximal production of these three bioproducts by Synechocystis.']"

Data on clinical presentation, treatment and outcome are limited especially in older age groups. Methods: We identified 127 patients with PTCL and NKTCL, excluding cutaneous T/NK cell lymphoma, aged over 60 years old from Thailand nationwide multicenter registry. Results: Of 127 patients, median age of diagnosis was 67 years old. Patients aged older than 75 years old had similar characteristics to younger (60–74 years old) but higher comorbidity index. Seventy-nine patients (62.2%) received intensive/definite multi-agent chemotherapy, however, the proportion was significant lower in older patients (70.4% vs 34.5%, p <. 001). After a median follow up duration of 17.3 months, 2-year progression free survival and overall survival were 38.1% and 48.5%. Univariate and multivariable analysis demonstrated older age, poor performance status and absence of definite multi-agent chemotherapy were associated with inferior survival. Definite multi-agent lymphoma specific chemotherapy was an independent factor for overall survival after adjustment for age, comorbidity index, performance status and prognostic index for T cell lymphoma. Conclusion: Despite overall poor prognosis of PTCL and NKTCL in older adults, chemotherapy could result in objective response and long-term survival in selected patients of this vulnerable age group thus emphasizing the importance of comprehensive geriatric evaluation.', 'Low toxicity and excellent outcomes in patients with DLBCL without residual lymphoma at the time of CD19 CAR T-cell therapy  2023 by The American Society of Hematology.CD19 chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy represents a breakthrough for patients with relapsed/refractory (R/R) diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), inducing sustained remissions in these patients. However, CAR T cells can result in significant toxicities. Preinfusion disease burden is associated with toxicities and outcomes after CAR T-cell therapy. We identified 33 patients with R/R DLBCL treated at 8 academic centers who had no detectable disease at the time of CAR T-cell therapy. The median time from leukapheresis to CAR T-cell infusion was 48 (19-193) days. Nine patients received axicabtagene ciloleucel, and 24 received tisagenlecleucel. There was no severe (grade ≥3) cytokine release syndrome, and only 1 patient developed severe neurotoxicity (grade 4). After a median follow-up of 16 months, 13 patients relapsed (39.4%) and 6 died (18.1%). One-year event-free survival and overall survival were 59.6% and 81.3%, respectively. Our findings suggest that, in patients with R/R DLBCL who have an indication for CAR T-cell therapy, treating patients in complete remission at the time of infusion is feasible, safe, and associated with favorable disease control.

The T-Cell Project is a global prospective cohort study that consecutively enrolled patients newly diagnosed with peripheral T-cell lymphoma, registered through a centralized computer database between September 2006 and February 2018. Of 1553 validated cases from 74 sites in 13 countries worldwide, 235 were reported as ALK- ALCL. The median age at diagnosis was 54 years (range, 18-89 years), with a male predominance (62%). Stage III to IV disease was identified in 71% of patients, bulky disease and bone marrow involvement were uncommon, and 66% of patients presented with a low (0-1) International Prognostic Index score. Of all treated patients, 85% received multiagent initial chemotherapy, and 8% were consolidated with autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation. The initial overall and complete response rates were 77% and 63%, respectively. After a median follow-up of 52 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 41-63), the median progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were 41 months (95% CI, 17-62) and 55 months (95% CI, 36-75), respectively. The 3- and 5-year PFS rates were 52% and 43%, and the 3- and 5-year OS rates were 60% and 49%. Treatments containing both anthracycline and etoposide were associated with superior OS (P 5.05) but not PFS (P 5.18). In this large prospective cohort study, outcomes comparable to those previously reported in the retrospective International Peripheral T-Cell Lymphoma Project were observed.

The calculation, which included spin–orbit coupling, shows that the hcp structure is thermodynamically and dynamically stable at high pressure. The electronic band structure calculations suggest the downshifting of the flat band through compression due to Lifshitz transitions. The Fermi surface shape of hcp Bi produces the metallicity in this material. The electron localization function reveals a weak bonding of Bi.

All rights reserved.We have used systematic ab initio evolutionary structural searching to uncover the high-pressure transformation pathway of a promising thermoelectric material, AgGaTe2. The global structures of the ternary Ag-Ga-Te system have been predicted up to 100 GPa. The known chalcopyrite phase at ambient pressure is validated by the searching method. The B3-like structure with the space group (s.g.) of P4¯ m2exhibits a metastable one at a low-pressure range. The first structural phase transition is calculated at about 4 GPa, processing the I4¯ 2d phase to a B1-like phase (s.g. Pmma). Other predicted structures, Pmn21and Pm phases, are potentially coexisting phases up to 30 GPa because of the slightly different enthalpy. This finding reasonably explains the ambiguous results in the previous experiments. The high-pressure phase beyond 30 GPa is proposed to be a short-range alloy of bcc-Te and B2-AgGa rather than a cation-disordered B2-like phase. The band gap of the I4¯ 2d phase is increased with increasing pressure, while the metastable P4¯ m2phase is a narrow band gap semiconductor. The electron-phonon coupling of the metallic phases of ternary IB-IIIA-VIA2compounds is derived for the first time in AgGaTe2. They exhibit superconductors with a maximum Tcof 2.4 K in the Pmma phase at 6 GPa.

Herein, the candidate structure of Li5MoH11 is predicted by exploiting the evolutionary searching. Its high-pressure phase adopts a hexagonal structure with P63/mcm space group. We used first-principles calculations including the zero-point energy to investigate the structures up to 200 GPa and found that the P63cm structure transforms into the P63/mcm structure at 48 GPa. Phonon calculations confirm that the P63/mcm structure is dynamically stable. Its stability is mainly attributed to the isostructural second-order phase transition. Our calculations reveal the electronic topological transition displaying an isostructural second-order phase transition at 160 GPa as well as the topology of its Fermi surfaces. We used the projected crystal orbital Hamilton population (pCOHP) to examine the nature of the chemical bonding and demonstrated that the results obtained from the pCOHP calculation are associated with the electronic band structure and electronic localized function.']"

In the previous studies, we developed methods to maintain supply-demand balance of the bulk power system with large PV integration by employing a battery energy storage system (BESS). However, those studies focused on the total supply-demand balance of the entire power system, and did not consider the behavior of the located PV systems and BESSs in the distribution systems.

We mainly focused on those for bulk power systems in our previous studies. However,since many PV-battery systems are introduced into a distribution system,the distribution system analysis is necessary. In this paper,aggregators that operate and control consumers' resources including PV-battery systems in distribution systems are assumed. The aggregators make supply-demand schedules to gain profits by electricity purchase and selling with the aggregated consumers' resources. However,because they do not consider the network constraints,the voltages or other power flow conditions might violate the distribution network constraints.

However, many Ti-based amorphous alloys contain toxic elements such as Al, Ni, V and Be. The presence of toxic elements within amorphous alloys is a concern when they are intended for use as a biomaterial. This problem has steered many researchers toward the development of Ti-based amorphous alloys without toxic elements. Our novel amorphous alloys were developed based on this principle. A series of Ti44Zr10Pd10Cu6+xCo23-xTa7 (x = 0, 4, 8) amorphous alloys were developed for biomedical application. A series of protocol tests were performed to check for biocompatibility and potential use of the novel alloys in humans. First, alloy ingots were alloyed by induction melting and then cast into copper molds. The cast rod was then used as the plasma cathode in a filtered cathodic vacuum arc deposition chamber to coat the 25-nm amorphous alloy thin film on the cover glass slides. These coated cover glass slides were then examined for biocompatibility. Cell proliferation and cell differentiation were investigated using Methylthiazol Tetrazolium assay test and by alkaline phosphatase assay on osteoblast like cells (SaOS-2), respectively. Field emission scanning electron microscopy was performed to evaluate the thin film surface characteristics. The thickness of thin film was analyzed using a Stylus profilometer. An adhesion scratch test was administered to evaluate the thin film adhesive strength and indirect hardness comparison. Electron Dispersive X-ray Spectrometry was performed to study the elemental composition. Lastly, a medical grade Ti-6Al-4V alloy was studied in parallel as a control material. Results indicated that all investigated Ti-based amorphous alloys were non-cytotoxic and were comparable to the Ti-6AL-4V. They also demonstrated an ability to support differentiation of osteoblast like cells. The adhesion and the hardness of the thin films on the substrates were superior to that of Ti-6Al-4V. The results suggested that the novel alloys in this study could be potentially utilized in biomedical applications.', 'Microstructure refinement and strengthening mechanisms of additively manufactured Ti-Zr alloys prepared from pre-mixed feedstock  2023 Elsevier B.V.In recent decades, advances in healthcare services have extended life expectancies worldwide and accelerated the demand for orthopedic implants. Accordingly, the development of safe materials for implants has become increasingly critical for minimizing health complications in patients. Herein, additively manufacturable binary titanium-zirconium (Ti-Zr) alloys are investigated as an alternative to the conventionally used Ti-6Al-4V alloys, in which the release of toxic vanadium (V) ions has been identified as a potential health hazard. Using commercially pure (CP)-Ti and pre-mixed blends of Ti 0–10 wt% ZrH2 powders as feedstock, laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) was used to successfully prepare high-density (>98%) Ti–Zr materials with a homogeneous distribution of Zr in the Ti. The presence of Zr was found to promote grain refinement, which reduced the large α/α’ grains in several hundred microns found in the Zr-free samples to a fine acicular grain structure (3.96 µm, 10 wt% ZrH2 addition). Tensile yield strength was also significantly enhanced with increasing Zr content with a remarkable improvement of up to 154% (853.9 MPa, 10 wt% ZrH2 addition) than the Zr-free Ti material, meanwhile retaining acceptable ductility (approximately 10%). To clarify the mechanisms of strengthening, the contributions of grain refinement and solid solution hardening are quantitatively evaluated. Given the excellent performance of the bulk materials, the fabrication of lattice scaffold structures from the Ti-Zr materials was investigated to further evaluate the applicability of the material fabricating lightweight, high-strength, and low-elastic modulus geometries. Ti–Zr scaffolds with different cellular structures are mechanically tested to determine the potential of each design. With compressive performance comparable to Ti-6Al-4V scaffold structures, and no inclusion of harmful elements, this study reveals the strong potential of the use of Ti-Zr scaffolds in orthopedic applications.', 'Improving the microstructure and mechanical properties of Zr-Ti alloy by nickel addition  2017 Elsevier B.V.The microstructure and mechanical properties of (Zr-Ti)1-χNiχ(χ =0, 1, 3, and 5 wt.%) alloys were studied. With the addition of nickel (Ni), the phase composition of alloys changes from α phase to α phase + hexagonal close packed (hcp) C14 Laves-phase. The thickness of lamellar α phase decreases with increasing Ni content. Optical microscopy and transmission electron microscopy results indicated that C14 Laves-phase is formed on the boundary. The Zr-Ti-3wt.%Ni alloys exhibits better ultimate compressive strength and compressive plasticity (1715 MPa and 9.70%) than that of Zr-Ti alloys (1598 MPa and 12.40%). The decrease of the average thickness of the lamellar α-phases (from 0.183 μm to 0.065 μm) leads to the improvement of the strength of the alloy. Additionally, the solid solution strengthening and the second phase strengthening are also important reasons for the improvement of the strength.']"

However, different force types lead to distinct PDL responses. Here, we report that pretreatment with an intermittent compressive force (ICF), but not a continuous compressive force (CCF), promoted human PDL (hPDL) osteogenic differentiation as determined by osteogenic marker gene expression and mineral deposition in vitro. ICF-induced osterix (OSX) expression was inhibited by cycloheximide and monensin. Although CCF and ICF significantly increased extracellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP) levels, pretreatment with exogenous ATP did not affect hPDL osteogenic differentiation. Gene-expression profiling of hPDLs subjected to CCF or ICF revealed that extracellular matrix (ECM)-receptor interaction, focal adhesion, and transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β) signaling pathway genes were commonly upregulated, while calcium signaling pathway genes were downregulated in both CCF- and ICF-treated hPDLs. The TGFB1 mRNA level was significantly increased, while those of TGFB2 and TGFB3 were decreased by ICF treatment. In contrast, CCF did not modify TGFB1 expression. Inhibiting TGF-β receptor type I or adding a TGF-β1 neutralizing antibody attenuated the ICF-induced OSX expression. Exogenous TGF-β1 pretreatment promoted hPDL osteogenic marker gene expression and mineral deposition. Additionally, pretreatment with ICF in the presence of TGF-β receptor type I inhibitor attenuated the ICF-induced mineralization.

Methods: Human dental pulp and periodontal ligament cells were isolated using explant method. Cells were seeded on Jagged1 immobilized surface. The mRNA expression was determined using real-time polymerase chain reaction. Mineral deposition was evaluated using alizarin red s staining. Publicly available database of gene expression profiles (GSE126249 and GSE94989) were downloaded and performed bioinformatic analysis to identify gene expression in osteoblast differentiation and regulation of osteoblast differentiation and mineralization ontology. Results: Both human dental pulp cells and human periodontal ligament cells expressed higher Notch target gene (HES1 and HEY1) when cells were seeded on Jagged1 immobilization surface. Jagged1 significantly increased an in vitro mineral deposition in both cell types after maintaining in osteogenic induction medium for 14 days.

Results: From bioinformatic analysis of gene expression profiling, various Notch signaling components were differentially expressed during osteogenic differentiation of human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal cells in vitro and bone healing period of murine tibial fracture in vivo. The common genes differentially regulated of these two datasets were Hes1, Aph1a, Nsctn, Furin, Adam17, Hey1, Pcsk5, Nedd4, Jag1, Heyl, Notch3, Dlk1, and Hey2. For an in vitro analysis, the mineral deposition markedly increased after seeding human bone-derived cells on Jagged1 immobilized surface, correspondingly with the increase of ALP mRNA expression. Jagged1 treatment downregulated TWIST2 mRNA expression in both human alveolar and iliac bone-derived cells. Conclusion: Notch signaling is regulated during osteogenic differentiation and bone healing. In addition, the activation of Notch signaling promotes osteogenic differentiation in human alveolar and iliac bone-derived cells.

Shallow groundwater had an average pH of 5.21 ± 1.90, ranging from 3.77 to 8.34, with average concentrations of As and Pb of 1.311 µg/L and 6.882 µg/L, respectively. Tap water had an average pH of 5.24 ± 1.63, ranging from 3.86 to 8.89, with the average concentrations of As and Pb of 0.77 µg/L and 0.004 µg/L, respectively. The levels of both As and Pb in the hair, fingernails and urine of shallow groundwater-consuming residents were greater than those in the hair, fingernails and urine of tap water-consuming residents. Interestingly, the As level in urine showed a linear relationship with the As concentration in groundwater (R2 = 0.91). The average water consumption rate was approximately two-fold higher than the standard; thus, its consumption posed a health risk even at the low As and Pb levels in the groundwater. The hazard index (HI) ranged from 0.01 to 16.34 (average of 1.20 ± 2.50), which was higher than the acceptable level. Finally, the concomitant factors for As and Pb in the urine, hair and nails from both binary logistic regression and odds ratio (OR) analysis indicated that groundwater consumption was the major concomitant risk factor. This study suggested that direct consumption of this groundwater should be avoided and that the groundwater should be treated, especially before consumption. In conclusion, urine is suggested to be a biomarker of daily exposure to As and Pb, while for long-term exposure to these metals, fingernails are suggested as a better biomarker than hair.']"

Strength anisotropy is an important aspect of clay behavior, but it is mostly neglected in practical stability analyses. In this study, the effects of undrained strength anisotropy and strength nonhomogeneity on the stability of unlined circular tunnels in clays are investigated. The static approach of lower-bound (LB) analysis using finite-element and second-order cone programming is employed to examine the aforementioned effects. The anisotropic shear strength of clay is modeled by employing an elliptical yield function under plane strain conditions. A complete set of dimensionless parameters covering the cover depth ratios of tunnels, normalized overburden pressure ratios, normalized strength gradient ratios of clays, and anisotropic strength ratios, are systematically investigated. The new LB solutions indicate that the stability load factor of the problem has a nonlinear relationship with the cover depth ratio and the anisotropic strength ratio, and there exists a linear relationship with the normalized overburden pressure and the normalized strength gradient. Their influence on the predicted failure mechanism is parametrically evaluated. A statistically approximate stability equation of unlined circular tunnels in anisotropic and non-homogeneous clay is proposed for the first time, which contains four new stability factors, namely, constant undrained strength, linearly increasing strength gradient, undrained strength anisotropy, and soil unit weight, and it can serve as a fast and accurate tool for predicting the undrained stability of this problem in practice.', 'Undrained Stability of Unlined Square Tunnels in Clays with Linearly Increasing Anisotropic Shear Strength  2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.In general, the undrained strength anisotropy of clays is found in nature. Its effect on a stability problem during undrained loading should be considered in order to get a more accurate and realistic safety assessment. In this paper, the undrained stability of unlined square tunnels in anisotropic and non-homogeneous clays is investigated by the lower bound finite element limit analysis using second-order cone programming. The anisotropic undrained strength of clays is modelled by using an elliptical strength envelope under plane strain conditions. The stability analyses of the problem are performed by the comprehensive investigations of the effects of the cover-depth ratio, the normalized overburden pressure, the normalized strength gradient, and the anisotropic strength ratio on the stability load factor and associated failure mechanisms. The computed lower bound solutions are validated with the existing results of square tunnels in isotropic clays. The new approximate equations of the stability load factor and factor of safety for square tunnels in anisotropic and non-homogeneous clays are first time presented by using a nonlinear regression, hence providing a reliable, accurate and convenient tool for stability analyses of the problem in practice. The numerical results reveal that the strength anisotropy has a significant impact on the stability load factor, especially when anisotropic clays have much difference in undrained strengths between compression and extension.', 'Three-dimensional undrained face stability of circular tunnels in non-homogeneous and anisotropic clays  2023 Elsevier LtdThe advanced 3D finite element limit analysis is employed to examine three-dimensional (3D) face stability of circular tunnels in undrained clays with the impact of strength non-homogeneity and anisotropy. The soil behaviour for all analyses is governed by the anisotropic undrained shear (AUS) strength model, which requires three anisotropic undrained shear strengths that are simply evaluated from conventional laboratory tests. The upper and lower bound solutions of 3D face stability of circular tunnels are accurately analyzed by considering four dimensionless parameters, including the cover-to-depth ratio, the overburden stress factor, the strength gradient ratio, and the anisotropic strength ratio. The significance of four dimensionless parameters on the stability load factor of the 3D face stability of circular tunnels, and the predicted failure mechanisms due to the influence of cover depth ratios, are also illustrated. A nonlinear regression analysis is employed to the computed data, which enables a new design equation of the factor of safety incorporating the conventional stability number. Thus, the new tunnel stability factors are proposed for the first time in the literature. A comprehensive application of the proposed safety factor equation is also presented and compared. The 3D effects of the tunnel face configuration between 3D geometry and 2D plane strain heading on the tunnel stability factors are also discussed. The new proposed design equation of the factor of safety provides an accurate and practical tool in assessing face stability of circular tunnels in non-homogeneous and anisotropic clays.']"

This research aims to experiment with Thai financial news sentiment classification and evaluate sentiment classification performance. In this research, we show financial news sentiment classification experimental results when comparing supervised and semi-supervised methods. In the research methodology, we use PyThaiNLP to tokenize and remove stopwords and split datasets into 85% of the training set and 15% of the testing set. Next, we classify sentiment using machine learning and deep learning approaches with feature extraction such as bag-of-words, term frequency-inverse document frequency, and word embedding (Word2Vec and Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT)) in given texts. The results show that support vector machine with the BERT model yields the best performance at 83.38%; in contrast, the random forest classifier with bag-of-words yields the worst performance at 54.10% in the machine learning approach. Another experiment reveals that long short-term memory with the BERT model yields the best performance at 84.07% in contrast to the convolutional neural network with bag-of-words, which yields the worst performance at 69.80% in the deep learning approach. The results imply that support vector machine, convolutional neural network, and long short-term memory are suitable for classifying sentiment in complex structure language.

Karger AG, Basel.Background: Ablative fractional carbon dioxide laser (AFCO2) resurfacing causes transient skin barrier disruption characterized by decreased skin hydration and increased transepidermal water loss (TEWL). Snail Soothing and Repairing (SSR) cream, containing several glycoproteins with potential antimicrobial and antioxidant effects, may benefit skin hydration promotion after the laser treatment. Objective: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of SSR cream in skin hydration promotion after AFCO2 resurfacing. Method: The study was a double-blinded, split-face, placebo-controlled trial in participants aged 18-50 years with atrophic acne scars on both cheeks. After AFCO2 resurfacing, participants applied the product or placebo on either cheek twice daily for 14 days. Corneometry, TEWL, colorimetry, and clinical assessments (edema, erythema, crusting, pruritus, and tightness score) were evaluated at baseline, day 7, and day 14 after AFCO2 resurfacing. Results: From 22 participants in the study, the SSR cream-treated sides showed significantly higher corneometry levels than placebo-treated sides at day 14 (p = 0.033), while TEWL and colorimetry levels were not different at any study visits. Pruritus and tightness scores of the SSR side were lower, but not significant, than the placebo. Other clinical assessments (edema, erythema, and crusting) showed similar results. No significant adverse events took place.

A recent study examining the microbiomes obtained via both skin biopsies and swabs revealed a significant difference in normal skin. We hypothesized that the microbiome profile of patients with psoriasis from tape stripping and skin biopsy might be different. This study sought to contribute to microbiome research on psoriasis by investigating the changes in the microbiome during narrowband ultraviolet B (NBUVB) therapy by comparing the results from the different sampling techniques of tape stripping and skin biopsy. Patients and Methods: Twenty-three participants, including 14 patients with chronic plaque psoriasis and nine healthy controls, were recruited, and nine patients with psoriasis completed 20-sessions of NBUVB treatment. Skin microbiota from both techniques was analyzed using the 16S rRNA gene at baseline and after treatment. Results: A clear difference was observed between the results from the two sampling techniques. Alpha diversity of the microbiota obtained from tape stripping was higher than that of the microbiota from skin biopsy, whereas beta diversity was clustered into two groups by sampling technique. The microbiome was altered during NBUVB treatment using both sampling techniques. Conclusion: Different sampling techniques resulted in different microbiome profiles in patients with psoriasis.

Results: Twenty-five healthy participants completed the study. Most participants had Fitzpatrick skin phototype IV. The TM-treated side showed statistically higher corneometry values and lower TEWL than the control side at every follow-up visit (P < 0.001). The crusting score at 96 hours post-AFCO2 treatment was also significantly better on the TM side. No adverse events occurred during the follow-up period.

The electrochemical behavior of 8-HQ on the CoPc-modified electrode was investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and square-wave voltammetry (SWV). The obtained results demonstrated that the CoPc-SPCE shows high electrocatalytic activity toward the oxidation of 8-HQ. The oxidation potential was shifted to a negative value compared to those obtained from the unmodified electrode. Under the optimized experimental conditions, a good linear relationship between the 8-HQ concentration and the peak current was obtained within the range of 10–250 μM with a detection limit of 0.89 μM. Furthermore, the method was successfully applied for the determination of 8-HQ in cosmetic samples.

The disposable devices show excellent conductivity and fast electron transfer kinetics. The results demonstrated that the modified electrode on PADs had excellent electrocatalytic activity towards the oxidation of glucose with NaOH as supporting electrolyte (0.1 M). The oxidation potential of glucose was negatively shifted to 0.64 V vs. the screen-printed carbon pseudo-reference electrode. The paper-based sensor comprised a wide linear concentration range for glucose, from 0.01 to 1.3 mM and 1.3–5.0 mM for low and high concentration of glucose assay, respectively, with a detection limit of 0.67 µM (S/N = 3).

Previous studies have extensively discussed customer shopping value and customer learning, but most studies have analyzed the influencing factor as a single entity and seldom investigated the combination of two factors based on the institutional trust–commitment mechanism. We based this study on the e-commerce institutional trust–commitment mechanism (customers’ trust and commitment calculation) to investigate the influence of customer learning (product and website knowledge) and customer shopping value (monetary value, product evaluation cost, and customer reputation) on customers’ intentions to purchase and reuse products. The data sample included 279 respondents with experience of electronic shopping in Taiwan. The results show that customer learning and customer shopping value positively and significantly influence customers’ trust and customers’ calculation commitment and indirectly influence customers’ intention to purchase and reuse. However, dimensions of customer learning, such as website knowledge, do not affect customers’ trust and commitment but have a partially an indirect relationship with customers’ trust via the influence of product knowledge.

Currently, the COVID-19 vaccine has been used in many countries, but it is still unable to control the spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, despite patients receiving full vaccination doses. Therefore, we aimed to appraise the booster effect of the different platforms of vaccines, including inactivated vaccine (BBIBP), viral vector vaccine (AZD122), and mRNA vaccine (BNT162b2), in healthy adults who received the full dose of inactivated vaccine (CoronaVac). The booster dose was safe with no serious adverse events. Moreover, the immunogenicity indicated that the booster dose with viral vector and mRNA vaccine achieved a significant proportion of Ig anti-receptor binding domain (RBD), IgG anti-RBD, and IgA anti-S1 booster response. In contrast, inactivated vaccine achieved a lower booster response than others. Consequently, the neutralization activity of vaccinated serum had a high inhibition of over 90% against SARS-CoV-2 wild-type and their variants (B.1.1.7–alpha, B.1.351–beta, and B.1.617.2–delta).

Healthy children between 5 and 11 years of age were enrolled and received the two-dose mRNA COVID-19 vaccine (BNT162b2) regimen or the inactivated (CoronaVac) vaccine followed by the BNT162b2 vaccine regimen. In addition, healthy children who received two doses of BBIBP-CorV between 1 and 3 months prior were enrolled to receive a heterologous BNT162b2 as a third dose (booster). Reactogenicity was assessed by a self-reported online questionnaire. Immunogenicity analysis was performed to determine binding antibodies to wild-type SARS-CoV-2. Neutralizing antibodies to Omicron variants (BA.2 and BA.5) were tested using the focus reduction neutralization test. Overall, 166 eligible children were enrolled. Local and systemic adverse events which occurred within 7 days after vaccination were mild to moderate and well-tolerated. The two-dose BNT162b2, CoronaVac followed by BNT162b2, and two-dose BBIBP-CorV followed by BNT162b2 groups elicited similar levels of anti-receptor-binding domain (RBD) IgG.

However, waning immunity and breakthrough infections have been observed. Therefore, we hypothesized that the heterologous booster might improve the protection against the delta and omicron variants. Methods: A total of 224 individuals who completed the 2-dose CoronaVac for 6 months were included. We studied reactogenicity and immunogenicity after a heterologous booster with the inactivated vaccine (BBIBP), the viral vector vaccine (AZD1222), and the messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) vaccine (both BNT162B2 and mRNA-1273). We also determined immunogenicity at 3- and 6-month boosting intervals. Results: The solicited adverse events were mild to moderate and well tolerated. Total receptor binding domain (RBD) immunoglobulin (Ig), anti-RBD IgG, focus reduction neutralization test (FRNT50) against delta and omicron variants, and T-cell response were highest in the mRNA-1273 group followed by the BNT162b2, AZD1222, and BBIBP groups, respectively. We also witnessed a higher total Ig anti-RBD in the long-interval than in the short-interval group. Conclusions: All 4 booster vaccines significantly increased binding and neutralizing antibodies in individuals immunized with 2 doses of CoronaVac. The present evidence may benefit vaccine strategies to thwart variants of concern, including the omicron variant.']"

In this work, a series of Ni-based layered double hydroxide (LDH) electrocatalyst models are constructed, and their OER performance is systematically screened via density functional theory (DFT) calculations. We discover that the exposed O sites on the pristine NiOOH substrate are more catalytically active than the Ni sites and play a vital role in the OER process. Moreover, introducing a second transition-metal heteroatom dopant is an effective strategy to boost the OER catalytic activity of the NiOOH matrix. Specifically, Ni@NiFe-2 exhibits an extraordinary OER performance with an overpotential of 0.21 V and can compete with or even outperform the current best catalysts such as RuO2 and IrO2.

Globally, IrN4@G is a very promising bifunctional catalyst for both OER and ORR with the extremely low overpotentials of 0.30 and 0.26 V, respectively. Such outstanding electrocatalytic performance is mainly attributed to the synergistic effect of Ir and N. More importantly, by constructing 2D activity volcano plots, we obtained the limiting overpotentials of TMN4@G system with the values of 0.26 V for OER and 0.24 V for ORR. These findings open up new opportunities for further exploring graphene-based materials for highly efficient OER/ORR electrocatalysts.', 'Ultrarapid synthesis Ni-Cu bifunctional electrocatalyst by self-etching electrodeposition for high-performance water splitting reaction  2021 Elsevier B.V.Bifunctional catalyst, as a feasible way to produce hydrogen, has been regarded as an effective issue for mitigation of the greenhouse effect, and thus has attracted extensive attention. Inspired by the traditional electrodeposition technology, we report a fast self-etching electrodeposition method to construct copper-incorporated three-dimensional Ni-Cu coated on copper sheets as a superior bifunctional catalyst. During the electrodeposition process, the copper substrate was corroded to form ammonium copper ions by ingenious design of the concentration of electrolyte, including ammonium chloride and sodium chloride. Meanwhile, we observe that the ratio of Ni to Cu could be changed via varying the current density. The optimized hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) overpotentials are 76 mV and 290 mV at 10 mA cm−2, respectively, which outperform the most reported bifunctional electrocatalysts until now. The calculation further demonstrates that the theoretical hydrogen desorption energy and OER overpotential of Ni-Cu are better than those of pure Ni and Cu. The prepared Ni-Cu electrocatalyst exhibits remarkable stability, especially in the HER reaction process stability test up to 50 h. The successful preparation of Ni-Cu electrocatalyst provides more possibility in the traditional electrodeposition synthesis of high performance electrocatalysts.']"

To investigate the differential expression of genes from P. monodon hemocytes that are involved in WSSV infection under the influence of PmVRP15 expression, suppression subtractive hybridization (SSH) of PmVRP15-silenced shrimp infected with WSSV was performed. The 189 cDNA clones of the forward library were generated by subtracting the cDNAs from WSSV-infected and PmVRP15 knockdown shrimp with cDNAs from WSSV-infected and GFP knockdown shrimp. For the opposite subtraction, the 176 cDNA clones in the reverse library was an alternative set of genes in WSSV-infected shrimp hemocytes in the presence of PmVRP15 expression.

Only transcript level of transglutaminase II, that functions in regulating hematopoietic tissue differentiation and inhibits mature hemocyte production in shrimp, was obviously down-regulated as observed from SSH results. Taken together, our results suggest that PmVRP15 might have a function relevant to hemocyte homeostasis during WSSV infection.', 'White spot syndrome virus impact on the expression of immune genes and gut microbiome of black tiger shrimp Penaeus monodon  2023, The Author(s).The gut microbiome plays an essential role in the immune system of invertebrates and vertebrates. Pre and pro-biotics could enhance the shrimp immune system by increasing the phenoloxidase (PO), prophenoloxidase (ProPO), and superoxide dismutase activities. During viral infection, the host immune system alteration could influence the gut microbiome composition and probably lead to other pathogenic infections. Since the JAK/STAT pathway is involved in white spot syndrome virus (WSSV) infection, we investigated the intestine immune genes of STAT-silenced shrimp. During WSSV infection, expression levels of PmVago1, PmDoral, and PmSpätzle in PmSTAT-silenced shrimp were higher than normal. In addition, the transcription levels of antimicrobial peptides, including crustinPm1, crustinPm7, and PmPEN3, were higher in WSSV-challenged PmSTAT-silenced shrimp than the WSSV-infected normal shrimp. Meanwhile, PmSTAT silencing suppressed PmProPO1, PmProPO2, and PmPPAE1 expressions during WSSV infection. The microbiota from four shrimp tested groups (control group, WSSV-infected, PmSTAT-silenced, and PmSTAT-silenced infected by WSSV) was significantly different, with decreasing richness and diversity due to WSSV infection. The relative abundance of Bacteroidetes, Actinobacteria, and Planctomycetes was reduced in WSSV-challenged shrimp. However, at the species level, P. damselae, a pathogen to human and marine animals, significantly increased in WSSV-challenged shrimp. In constrast, Shewanella algae, a shrimp probiotic, was decreased in WSSV groups. In addition, the microbiota structure between control and PmSTAT-silenced shrimp was significantly different, suggesting the importance of STAT to maintain the homeostasis interaction with the microbiota.', 'Heat shock protein 70 from Litopenaeus vannamei (LvHSP70) is involved in the innate immune response against white spot syndrome virus (WSSV) infection  2019 Elsevier LtdWhite spot syndrome (WSS) caused by white spot syndrome virus (WSSV) is a severe infectious disease in shrimp aquaculture. To find effective therapeutics to control WSSV, it is indispensable to understand the innate immune responses of shrimp to WSSV infection. Previous report demonstrated that the Litopenaeus vannamei heat shock protein 70 (LvHSP70) could induce shrimp innate immunity against bacterial infection. Herein, we further investigate the role of LvHSP70 in anti-WSSV infection. The temporal expression of LvHSP70 was significantly upregulated 2.5- and 1.5-fold at 6 and 24 h post systemic WSSV infection suggesting that the LvHSP70 was a WSSV responsive gene. The recombinant protein of LvHSP70 (rLvHSP70) was produced in an Escherichia coli system and its effect in protection against WSSV infection was investigated. Intramuscularly injection of juvenile shrimp with 1 nmol of rLvHSP70 could significantly prolong 50% mortality of WSSV-infected shrimp from 3 days to 5 days as compared to the control group injected with bovine serum albumin (BSA). Consistently, the injection of rLvHSP70 resulted in 24-fold, 20-fold and 100-fold decrease in the viral copy number after 6, 12 and 24 h post injection, respectively, compared to the control shrimp injected with BSA. Interestingly, it was found that the rLvHSP70 enhanced the expression of the key gene in the prophenoloxidase (proPO) activating system, LvproPO, but reduced the expression of Lvcaspase2 and LvIAP in WSSV-infected shrimp. These results suggested that the LvHSP70 is an important molecule involved in antiviral defense in shrimp presumably via modulating the proPO system and apoptosis.']"

Background While online learning has become commonplace in most US based universities, some international educational institutions are just now dealing with the enor-mous task of introducing online learning to their academic communities and working with both faculty and students for successful implementations. In Thai-land, there is a national initiative to harness the power of online learning together with other technological innovations to facilitate an increase in learning outcomes and provide additional access to education for students within public educational institutions. Methodology Online learning self-efficacy data was collected from 856 newly admitted English as a second language (ESL) students at a large public university in Thailand. Par-ticipants were provided an email link to an online survey either via a direct email solicitation or a web link posted by their course instructors. The survey consisted of 8 demographic items and 29 self-efficacy items on a 4-point Likert-type scale. Contribution This paper adds to the body of research on self-efficacy in online learning con-text by examining the levels of online learning self-efficacy of ESL students in Thailand, where online learning is still not as prevalent as in the United States and many other regions. Findings Significant correlations were found between online learning self-efficacy levels and demographic characteristics including self-report computer skills, comfort level using the internet, self-reported English proficiency scores, and prior online learning experience. ESL learners participating in this study were found to have high levels of online learning self-efficacy, which indicated a readiness for en-gagement in online learning courses. Recommendations for Practitioners As indicated by the results of the study, ESL students who were better at using computers and more comfortable surfing the internet were found to be more confident that they would do well in online learning environments. Therefore, it is recommended that sufficient training should be provided to support this transi-tion by helping students, especially those with lower computer skills and comfort levels using the internet, get started and supporting them along the way. Also, at the very first stage of transitioning into online learning, the institution may first start with partially online courses into which a mixture of both online and face-to-face elements is incorporated. This will allow students to gradually adjust themselves into the new instructional delivery system and technologies that come with it. Once students are well-adjusted and familiar with the new learning envi-ronment, and assessment of the effectiveness of the partial integration has been conducted, the institution can consider offering courses that are entirely online. Recommendations for Researchers Faculty and institution readiness for the adoption of online learning should also be taken into consideration in future work. To address the identified limitations, we recommend that inclusion of participants from across content domain would provide a more representative and generalizable result. Impact on Society Incorporation of online learning as a standard instructional strategy will improve access to the educational system within Thailand. Assessing student readiness for this non-traditional way of learning may facilitate institutions' ability to better plan how to effectively incorporate online learning into its curricula. Future Research This student focused study was a follow-up to a faculty focused study attempting to indicate the level of readiness for this institution to broadly adopt online learn-ing. Future research could be conducted at the organization/institution perspec-tive using appropriate frameworks to address the last element of readiness for online learning adoption that considers the three facets of student, faculty, and institution. After the completion of this phase of affective/attitudinal research and the implementation of online learning within this institution, we recommend moving on to the measure effectiveness of the new instructional methodology.""]"

Parkinson's disease is a nervous system disorder which commonly causes tremors, but the disorder also commonly causes stiffness or slowing of movement. These symptoms are not only caused by Parkinson's disease but also the other movement disorder sickness. The doctors who are specialist in the Parkinson's disease can simply diagnose the tremors, which usually be hand muscle tremor of the patient. But conversely, the out-patient-department doctors find that it is difficult to diagnose those symptoms. This work proposes the use of machine learning for the Parkinson's disease data to assist the physician diagnosis.

All rights reserved.Purpose of review We focus on new insights in the pathophysiology of Parkinson's disease tremor, essential tremor, tremor in dystonia, and orthostatic tremor. Recent findings Neuroimaging findings suggest that Parkinson's disease resting tremor is associated with dopaminergic dysfunction, serotonergic dysfunction, or both. Not all tremors in Parkinson's disease have the same pathophysiology: postural tremor in Parkinson's disease can be subdivided into pure postural tremor, which involves nondopaminergic mechanisms, and re-emergent tremor, which has a dopaminergic basis. Unlike Parkinson's disease tremor, essential tremor has an electrophysiological signature suggestive of a single (or several tightly coupled) oscillators. Visual feedback increases essential tremor and enhances cerebral activity in the cerebello-Thalamo-cortical circuit, supplementary motor area, and parietal cortex. Little is known about dystonic tremor but the available evidence suggests that both the basal ganglia and the cerebellum play a role. Finally, recent work in orthostatic tremor points towards the role of the pontine tegmentum and dysfunctional cerebellar-SMA circuitry. Summary Many pathological tremors involve the cerebello-Thalamo-cortical circuitry, and the clinical and pathophysiological boundaries between tremor disorders are not always clear. Differences between tremor disorders-or even individual patients-may be explained by the specific balance of neurotransmitter degeneration, by distinct circuit dynamics, or by the role of regions interconnected to the cerebello-Thalamo-cortical circuit."", ""Predictors and level of knowledge regarding Parkinson's disease among patients: A cross-sectional study from Thailand  2020 BMJ Publishing Group.

Knowledge and factors responsible for Parkinson's disease (PD) are important among patients that could positively affect their attitude and perceptions. This study was conducted to determine the factors influencing and level of the knowledge regarding Parkinson's disease in Thailand. Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted on 125 patients admitted in King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital Bangkok, Thailand. Sociodemographic variables and clinical characteristics were collected as predictors of knowledge, treatment, and self-care for PD. A validated, piloted, pretested tool was used for data collection. Multiple linear regressions were used to find the most influencing predictor of knowledge about PD. The study was approved by the Ethical Board of Chulalongkorn University, Thailand. Results: The level of education was found to be the most significant (P = 0.005) predictor of PD knowledge. PD patients with high education had significantly higher knowledge scores than those with low education in all aspects of disease (P = 0.041), treatment (P = 0.014), and self-care (P = 0.011). PD knowledge was poor in variables such as levodopa (62%), nonmotor symptoms (54%), and stem cell transplantation (40%), respectively.

A novel solid carbon-supported potassium hydroxide catalyst derived from the pyrolysis of cultivated banana (Musa sapientum) peels and potassium carbonate (K2CO3) was used as the catalyst for biodiesel production. A five-level (− 2, − 1, 0, + 1, and + 2) RSM with a four-factor central composite design of independent variable factors (methanol to palm oil molar ratio (6:1–18:1), catalyst loading (3–7 wt.%), reaction time (30–150 min), and reaction temperature (50–70 °C)) were randomly setup using the Design of Experiment program. The 30 wt.% K2CO3 catalyst calcined at 600 °C under atmosphere pressure exhibited the highest catalytic activity, since the pyrolysis ash was rich in K that formed a basic heterogeneous catalyst. Within the range of selected operating conditions, the optimized methanol:oil molar ratio, catalyst loading, reaction time, and reaction temperature were found to be 15:1, 4 wt.%, 120 min, and 65 °C, respectively, to give a biodiesel yield of 99.16%.

The response surface method based on Box Behnken experimental design was used to optimize the biodiesel yield. The prepared catalyst was characterized by scanning electron microscopy coupled with energy dispersive spectroscopy (SEM-EDS), Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analyses. EDS analysis of the synthesis catalyst exhibited the presence of active potassium species for high catalytic activity. The 30K/SCG–600 catalysts exhibited the highest catalytic activity and were rich in K that formed a basic heterogeneous catalyst and the highest total basicity. The effects of catalyst loading (4.5–5.5 wt.%), methanol to oil molar ratio (6:1–12:1), and reaction time (60–120 min) on the transesterification were investigated. The results showed that the predicted optimum response for biodiesel yield from RSM was 97.01%, which could be obtained using methanol: oil molar ratio of 6.68:1, catalyst loading of 4.94 wt.%, and reaction time at 82.42 min.

It was prepared as a heterogeneous catalyst for the transesterification of palm oil to fatty acid methyl esters. Objectives: A central composite response surface methodology was used to optimize the biodiesel yield. The effects were investigated of different K2CO3impregnation levels on MA (0 by weight percentage (wt.%), 25 wt.%, 30 wt.% and 35 wt.%) and then on the catalyst loading (2.32-5.68 wt.%), the methanol-to-oil molar ratio (3.95:1-14.05:1), and the reaction time (39.55- 140.45 min) of the transesterification reaction at 65 °C. Materials & Methods: The mangosteen peel was procured from Songkhla province, Thailand and the palm oil was purchased from a local supermarket in Songkhla province. The catalysts were prepared using the incipient wetness impregnation method and applied for transesterification of palm oil with methanol to produce biodiesel. The reaction process was optimized in terms of the biodiesel yield using response surface methodology based on a central composite design. Results: The results demonstrated that the catalyst consisting of 30 wt.% K2CO3loaded MA (30K-MA) had the highest catalytic activity. Using the 30K-MA catalyst at 65 °C, the maximum biodiesel yield of 97.9% was prodcued at a catalyst loading of 4.5 wt.%, a methanol-to-oil molar ratio of 10.8:1 and a reaction time of 98.7 min. Main finding: The 30K-MA catalyst maintained sufficient catalytic activity (above 65% biodiesel yield) until the fourth reaction cycle, demonstrating the possibility of developing heterogeneous alkali catalysts from MA for biodiesel production.']"

The deposits show a distinct spatial zonal distribution and occur in specific tectonic terranes. Combining regional geological data and ore deposit distribution data with Hf-isotopic data of zircons in igneous rocks can be used to investigate the relationship between crustal construction processes and metallogeny. In this study, we investigated the Sukhothai Fold Belt, which is composed of quartz monzodiorite, granodiorite, syenogranite, and monzogranite of I- and S-type affinities. All granitoids were analyzed for zircon U–Pb geochronology and Lu–Hf isotopic analysis. The granitoids of the Sukhothai Fold Belt yielded U–Pb zircon ages ranging from ~243 to 202 Ma, which mark the timing of subduction to the syn-collisional stage between the Sibumasu–Indochina terranes at ~243–237 Ma and the timing of post-collision between the Sibumasu–Indochina terranes during 230–202 Ma. In addition, an age of ~43 Ma in the south of the Sukhothai Fold Belt may indicate intrusion during the sinistral movement of the Klaeng and Mae Ping fault zones resulted from the Indian–Eurasian plate collision. The Doi Tung quartz monzodiorite provided an age of ~350 Ma as a timing of formation of the Sukhothai Fold Belt. The negative and positive initial εHf values (−8.0 to +9.2) with two-stage depleted mantle model ages (TDMC of 2.2–0.6 Ga) of zircons from the Sukhothai Fold Belt granitoids indicate that the sources of their magma derived from partial melting of old continental crust and young oceanic crust, which probably mixed with a mantle-derived magma. A zircon Hf-isotope compilation including the data obtained in this study and previously reported values was used to prepare a map that allows a comparison between magmatic source and mineral deposit distribution in Thailand. The spatial distribution of Hf isotopic data reveals a distinct zonation, with initial εHf values decreasing from the east to the west, that is, from the western margin of the Indochina Terrane or the Loei Fold Belt to the Sukhothai Fold Belt, the Inthanon Zone and the Sibumasu Terrane. The magmatic source for the granitoids in the Loei Fold Belt is dominated by mantle-derived components, as shown by positive average initial εHf values (+1.0 to +12.7), and contributed to porphyry-related skarn copper–gold and iron and epithermal gold mineralization. In contrast, magmas in the Sibumasu Terrane and the Inthanon Zone originated from melting of old crustal materials, as indicated by mostly negative average initial εHf values (−15.1 to +0.8), and are responsible for S-type granite-related tin-tungsten mineralization. The average initial εHf values (−5.0 to +11.0) from the intrusions in the Sukhothai Fold Belt suggest mixed sources, including evolved and juvenile magmatic materials, which generated the orogenic gold deposits and other vein-type antimony, tungsten, fluorite, and base metal deposits. These results imply a close spatial correlation between the source of magmatism in each tectonic terrane of Thailand and different metal ore deposits. These isotope maps can be used as a powerful tool in the exploration for various commodities at the regional scale.', ""Revisiting the tectonic evolution of the Triassic Palaeo-Tethys convergence zone in northern Thailand inferred from detrital zircon U-Pb ages  The Author(s), 2020. Published by Cambridge University Press.Detrital zircon U-Pb ages for sediments in and around the Palaeo-Tethyan convergence zone in northern Thailand provide constraints for tectonic interpretations of the Indochina Block, the Sibumasu Block, the Inthanon Zone accretionary complex and the Nan Back-arc Basin during the Triassic. In sedimentary rocks of the Indochina Block, almost all of the Palaeozoic and Triassic zircons were sourced from the collision zone between the Indochina and South China blocks, and an active continental margin in the western Indochina Block. Sediments of the Sibumasu Block were supplied by erosion of Archaean basement and from the Grenville and the Pan African orogenies, but show no record of Permian to Triassic igneous activity. Accretionary complex sediments have provenances of both the Sukhothai Arc and the Indochina and South China blocks, with detrital zircons of various ages being supplied from crustal uplift and erosion related to the Indosinian I orogeny. Sedimentary rocks of the Nan Back-arc Basin are widely distributed not only in the Nan-Uttaradit but also in northern Sukhothai areas. The origin of the Pha Som Metamorphic Complex and associated formations can be traced to basin-filling sediments in the Nan Back-arc Basin. These detrital zircon U-Pb ages have also allowed identification of the changing tectonic setting in the Palaeo-Tethys convergence zone from the 'erosion of Proterozoic continental basement' to 'Palaeozoic active continental margin in the western Indochina Block' and 'Palaeozoic, Permian to Triassic collision zone between the South China and Indochina blocks' through to 'Triassic active Sukhothai Arc'."", 'Permian–Triassic back-arc basin development in response to Paleo-Tethys subduction, Sa Kaeo–Chanthaburi area in Southeastern Thailand  2018 International Association for Gondwana ResearchThe Sa Kaeo Back-arc Basin in Southeastern Thailand developed behind the Sukhothai Arc along the western margin of the Indochina Block during the Permian to Triassic in response to the subduction of the Paleo-Tethys oceanic plate. To clarify its tectonic evolution of spreading, basin-infilling, and closure, we have investigated the provenance of its clastic sediments, the U-Pb ages of detrital zircons, the geochemistry of its basaltic rocks, and the structures in mélange. The rocks in the Sa Kaeo Back-arc Basin include two contrasting lithological units: the Thung Kabin Mélange, composed mainly of basaltic rocks, chert, limestone, and sandstone, along with mélange; and the Pong Nam Ron Formation, a thick succession of clastic sediments. Our observations suggest that the clastic sediments of the Pong Nam Ron Formation were deposited widely over the oceanic rocks (basaltic rocks, chert, and limestone) of the Thung Kabin Mélange. Geochemical analyses indicate that sandstones in both units (the Thung Kabin Mélange and the Pong Nam Ron Formation) are characterized by a provenance of mostly basaltic rocks. The U-Pb ages of detrital zircons from both units present similar age distributions: the youngest single-grain zircon (YSG) is early Late Triassic in age, the youngest cluster of zircons (YC1σ) is latest Permian to earliest Triassic in age, and there is a range of other Paleozoic and Proterozoic zircons. Based on these geochemical analyses and the U-Pb dating, the sandstones of both units had the same provenance. In addition, the basaltic rocks of the Thung Kabin Mélange are originated from back-arc basin basalts. These new observations have allowed us to reconstruct the tectonic evolution of the basin. In the Early Permian, spreading took place in the basin accompanied by basaltic magmatism. Subsequently, corresponding to an inactive period of the Sukhothai Arc into the Middle Triassic, the Sa Kaeo Back-arc Basin subsided, and a deep-sea environment prevailed with the formation of Permian cherts, Permian limestones, and Middle Triassic cherts. During the Triassic, the basin was filled by clastic sediments and eventually closed. The clastic sediments were sourced directly from the back-arc basin basalts, as well as from the felsic volcanic rocks of the active Sukhothai Arc (which yield Permian to Triassic zircons), and from the continental materials of the Indochina Block (Paleozoic and Proterozoic zircons). After the closure of the Sa Kaeo Back-arc Basin, the discussed area was affected by the termination fault-fan related to the Mae Ping Fault Zone.']"

To this end, we performed histological analysis of the ovaries (n = 20, all females, total length 15 to 20 cm) obtained from the Pranburi River estuary, Thailand, during January to April 2017. The ovary of this species was a paired sac-like organ located in parallel to the digestive tract.

The ovary contained oocytes at different developmental phases. Most oocytes were in the secondary growth phase (60%), although those in primary growth phase (33.33%) and a few oogonia (6.66%) were also observed. The primary growth phase was associated with accumulated lipid droplets and cortical alveoli, whereas oocytes at the secondary growth phase contained larger lipid droplets, spherical yolk granules, and associated changes of the follicular cell.

In this study, we examined the structure and development of gonads in the grunting toadfish Allenbatrachus grunniens (Linnaeus, 1758) using morphological, histological and ultrastructural methods. The fish were collected from the Pranburi River Estuary, Thailand, during the annual reproductive period for this species (January to December 2018). The ovary of this species was paired and had elongated sac-like structures parallel to the kidneys and the digestive tract. In females, we identified 4 oocyte differentiation phases in the ovary including oogonia proliferation phase, a primary growth phase that was further classified into 2 steps (perinucleolar and oil droplets-cortical alveolar steps), and a secondary growth phase that also contained 2 steps (secondary growth and full-grown oocyte steps) and post-ovulatory phases, indicating an asynchronous pattern in ovarian development for this species. Transmission electron microscopy showed the 4 layers including the zona pellucida, basement membrane, granulosa cells and theca cells, all of which initially appeared in the oil droplets-cortical alveolar stage. The zona pellucida and the granulosa cells were highly developed during the secondary growth stage. The granulosa cells contained abundant smooth endoplasmic reticulum near the mitochondria. In males, the spermatogenesis was classified into spermatogonium to spermatozoa. Finally, we associated the morphological gonadal developments (stage I-IV) and the gonadosomatic index (GSI value) with the cellular developmental processes in both sexes.

Under the ovarian differentiation, our observation indicated that the ovarian parenchyma of N. lankesteri during 1.8 – 2.4 cm in standard length (SL) was accompanied by the secondary growth phases. Identification of the post-ovulatory phase was detected during our sampling periods, indicating to entire life in the Pranburi River estuary as well as true resident species. In the male reproductive system of N. lankesteri, the mature testicular parenchyma was organized morphologically as a single organ and histologically appeared to be a restricted spermatogonial lobular testis type. The differentiation of the spermatogenetic stage was composed of three phases including spermatogonial, spermatocyte and spermiogenetic phases.

As the most-used anode material, zinc metal always encounters poor coulombic efficiency (CE) and cycling stability, because of the serious zinc dendrite and harmful side reactions on Zn surface. Here, a solid-phase non-adhesive homogeneous Nano-Si layer has been embedded on the Zn surface (Zn-Si) via an ultra-facile grinding method. The Nano-Si layer can regulate an even electric field distribution to achieve a homogeneous zinc deposition, and it also can greatly lower the charge transfer resistance and nucleation energy barrier of Zn2+ to facilitate the zinc deposition, thus achieving a dendrites-free and long-life Zn anode. Encouragingly, the zinc symmetrical battery with Zn-Si anode delivers a superior CE of 99.6 % in 1000 cycles under 5 mA cm−2, and a stable cycle lifespan of 3600 h under 1 mA cm−2 with much lower polarization potential (42 mV), outperforming the symmetrical battery with pure Zn anode (455 h, 59 mV) and various previously reported strategies. Additionally, the effectiveness of Nano-Si layer is further proved in the Zn-Si/MnO2 battery, which presents a greatly improved capacity retention and cycling performance.', 'Polypyrrole/reduced graphene oxide composites coated zinc anode with dendrite suppression feature for boosting performances of zinc ion battery  2022, The Author(s).Metallic zinc (Zn) anode has been received a great promise for aqueous rechargeable zinc-ion batteries (ZIBs) due to its intrinsic safety, low cost, and high volumetric capacity. However, the dendrite formation regarding the surface corrosion is the critical problems to achieve the high performance and the long lifespans of ZIBs. Here, we purpose the facile cyclic voltammetry deposition of polypyrrole/reduced graphene oxide (PPy/rGO) composites coated onto Zn 3D surface as Zn anode for ZIBs. As results, the deposited PPy/rGO layer demonstrates the homogeneous distribution covering onto Zn surface, effectively suppressing the formation of dendrite. Additionally, a symmetric cell of the PPy/rGO coated Zn remarkably enhances an electrochemical cycling with a low voltage hysteresis for zinc plating/stripping, which is superior to the pristine Zn cell. In addition, the deposited layer of PPy/rGO on Zn effectively improves the reactivity of electrochemically active surface area and the intrinsic electronic configurations, participating in extraction/intercalation of Zn2+ ions and leading to enhance ZIBs performance. The coin cell battery of Zn-PPy/rGO//MnO2 can deliver a high initial discharge capacity of 325 mAh/g at 0.5A/g with a good cycling stability up to 50% capacity retention after 300 cycles. Thus, these achieved results of Zn-PPy/rGO//MnO2 battery with dendrite-free feature effectively enhance the life-performance of ZIBs and open the way of the designed coating composite materials to suppress dendrite issues.', 'Ethylene carbonate as an organic electrolyte additive for high-performance aqueous rechargeable zinc-ion batteries  2022 The Korean Society of Industrial and Engineering ChemistryRechargeable zinc-ion batteries (ZIBs) have recently received tremendous attention for large-scale electrochemical energy storage, but their poor cyclic stability and reversibility and low coulombic efficiency, which are mainly caused by dendrite issues and parasitic reactions of zinc (Zn) anode, prevent them from achieving their full potential. Herein, we investigated the use of ethylene carbonate (EC) as an electrolyte additive to improve the performance of ZIBs. The addition of 6% (w/v) EC substantially enhanced the first-cycle discharge capacity from 115 to 203 mAh g−1 at 0.1 A g−1, while retaining this high discharge capacity (102% retention of the initial capacity) after 200 cycles, and from 43 to 54 mAh g−1 at 1 A g−1 with 85% capacity retention after 1,000 cycles. The ex-situ characterizations and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy analysis before and after Zn–MnO2 and Zn–Zn battery cycling suggested that the addition of EC could effectively suppress dendrite formation and parasitic reactions on the Zn anode, possibly via electrolyte/Zn anode interface film formation in the presence of EC. Moreover, the presence of EC made the MnO2 morphology more open and accessible. These led to substantial improvements in the rate performance and cyclability compared to the additive-free electrolyte.']"

The technique is established in a broad framework allowing a medium made of generally anisotropic materials and cracks of arbitrary shape and under general loading conditions to be treated. A pair of weakly singular, weak-form, displacement and traction boundary integral equations is utilized to formulate the key equations governing the unknown crack-face fields. Besides the basic benefits such as the reduction of spatial dimensions of the solution space and the efficient treatment of unbounded domains and remote boundary data, use of such integral equations in the formulation offers additional positive features including the computational simplicity resulting from the weakly singular nature of all involved integrals and the involvement of a complete set of crack-face displacement fields. A weakly singular symmetric Galerkin boundary element method together with the special near-front approximation is utilized to solve for the unknown relative crack-face displacement whereas the sum of the crack-face displacement is obtained from the displacement boundary integral equation for cracks via the Galerkin technique. The latter step is one of the essential aspects of the present study that provides the direct means for determining the T-stress data in terms of the sum of the crack-face displacement in the neighborhood of the crack-front. An extensive numerical study is conducted for various scenarios and a selected set of results is reported to demonstrate both the accuracy and capability of the proposed technique.', 'A rational beam-elastic substrate model with incorporation of beam-bulk nonlocality and surface-free energy  2021, Società Italiana di Fisica and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.In this study, a rational beam-elastic substrate model with inclusion of nonlocal and surface-energy effects is developed for bending and buckling analyses of nanobeams lying on elastic substrate media. The beam-section kinematics follows Euler–Bernoulli beam hypothesis. The thermodynamics-based strain gradient theory is employed to represent the beam-bulk nonlocality while the Gurtin–Murdoch surface theory is utilized to account for the surface-free energy. Interaction between the beam and its underlying substrate medium is described by the Winkler foundation model. The governing equilibrium equation and admissible natural boundary conditions are consistently obtained using the virtual displacement principle. To characterize bending and buckling responses of the new beam-elastic substrate model, three numerical examples are employed: the first demonstrates the capability of the proposed model in eliminating the paradoxical behavior present in the Eringen nonlocal differential model; the second characterizes the bending response of the free–free nanobeam-elastic substrate system; and the third examines the influences of several model parameters as well as the size-dependent effect on the buckling response of the simply supported nanobeam-elastic substrate system.', 'Analysis of near-interface cracks in three-dimensional anisotropic multi-materials by efficient BIEM  2023 Elsevier LtdThis paper presents the full analysis of near-interface cracks in three-dimensional linear elastic multimaterial bodies by a weakly singular boundary integral equation method (BIEM). The proposed technique was implemented in a general framework that allowed the treatment of finite cracked bodies with general configurations, material anisotropy, and mode-mixity. A system of integral equations governing unknown data on the boundary, crack surface, and material interface was established using a pair of weakly singular weak-form displacement and traction integral equations together with continuity along the material interface. A symmetric Galerkin boundary element method along with the finite element technique were implemented to solve the governing integral equations. In addition, the special near-front interpolation was employed to enhance the approximation of the relative crack-face displacement in the neighborhood of the crack front. The solved crack-face data were used directly to post-process the stress intensity factors and T-stresses along the crack front. An extensive numerical study was carried out not only to demonstrate the accuracy, convergence, and capability of the proposed technique, but also to explore the influence of material stiffness and distance to the material interface on fracture data along the crack front.']"

To achieve that, frequency modulated continuous wave (FMCW) based Photonic Radar is proposed. For multiple targets detection, wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) scheme is used in conjugation with polarization division multiplexing (PDM) scheme. Impact of varying bandwidth is analyzed upon the performance of the proposed system using numerical simulations. The system is simulated for detecting and ranging over 100 meters by analyzing received echoes and verifying the range frequency with theoretically calculated values while effective operation is measured in terms of received power under varying level of attenuation up to 75 dB/Km under rain and fog conditions. Lastly, the system is replicated for range resolution with four varying operational bandwidths from 600 MHz to 4 GHz.', ""Performance of SOA in 100GBase-LR4 Link  2022 IEEE.Our Semiconductor Optical Amplifier (SOA) is evaluated as a pre-amplifier, having 30-dB gain at 1310 nm and 0.3-A, in the 100GBASE-LR4 over 10, 20, 30 and 40-km Single Mode Fibers (SMF). Its Optical Signal Noise Ratio (OSNR) is linear to input power, and thus degrades over lower inputs causing thicker data waveforms at longer SMFs. Across higher inputs, the dominant effect is data pattern shown as multiple overshoots of bit 1. The longer Pseudo-Random Binary Sequence (PRBS) and slow SOA's response worsen pattern effect. Our SOA's response is approximate 60 ps. Comparing at 10-11 Bit Error Rate (BER), the SOA's Input Power Dynamic Range (IPDR) is reduced from 9.75 dB using shorter PRBS7 to 3.4 dB using PRBS31. The BER results of 1-channel amplification at 6 SOA's inputs confirm both OSNR degradation and pattern effect. The optimal input with minimum BER is -13 dBm, corresponding to 40-km SMF's attenuation. All BER curves of 4-channel amplification after 10, 20, 30 and 40-km SMFs are plotted. As SMF expands, the additional penalties due to Chromatic Dispersion (CD) at 10-9 BER rise from 0.25 dB to 1 dB. Comparing 1 and 4-channel amplifications, the additional penalties due to Cross Gain Modulation (XGM) are 2-2.25 dB. Ultimately, our pre-amplifier SOA can extend the 10-km limit of 100GBASE-LR4 link to 40 km with a total penalty of 5.75 dB. Furthermore, it can be applied as the inline-amplifier to achieve 80-km distance, based on 10-12 BER result at -5 dBm received power by QSFP28 transceiver."", ""Data pattern effect of SOA at 25 Gbps with different PRBS and multi-channel amplification  2021 IEEE.This paper studies pattern effect of Semiconductor Optical Amplifier (SOA) at 25.78125 Gbps in 100GBASE-LR4 standard: 4 channels at 1295, 1300, 1305 and 1310 nm. Three issues are evaluated: input powers of SOA, different Pseudo-Random Binary Sequence (PRBS) patterns, and multi-channel amplification. Based on characteristic measurements of SOA, the maximum gain is 25 dB at 0.2-A current and 1310-nm input, showing 3-dB saturation gain at -15 dBm input power. The 3-dB gain spectrum is 20.9 nm wide center at 1311.5 nm wavelength. The OSNR (Optical Signal to Noise Ratio) is linearly proportional to SOA's input power. The first issue, Bit Error Rate (BER) gets worse as SOA's input rises into saturation region due to severe data pattern effect. For example, comparing among -17.5, -12.5 and -7.5 dBm inputs, the lower power gives less BER. Hence, the SOA is better applied as pre-amplifier. The second issue (PRBS: 7, 23 and 31), their corresponding BERs get worse with longer patterns. For instance, PRBS31 always shows higher BER, while PRBS7 can offer error-free transmission. The BER performance of Gigabit Ethernet link using 8b/10b coding is well estimated with PRBS7. The third issue, when 3 channels are added to 1310-nm main channel for SOA amplification, the BERs results have more power penalty than the 1-channel case due to XGM (Cross Gain Modulation) inside SOA. However, the SOA can operate as pre-amplifier in multi-channel transmission, such as to extend the 100GBase-LR4 (10-km limit) links to 100GBase-ER4 (40-km limit) without a replacement of expensive optical transceivers.""]"

Since 1982, problems of stability and deterioration of national culture led the government to promote national culture through a “conservation approach” to Thai traditional music in accordance with the customs of the Royal Court. This received governmental support for promotion as national cultural heritage to be passed down to posterity. This involved, for example, securing the involvement of various relevant government agencies, opening Thai music education curricula in higher education institutions, creating criteria for what constitutes “Thai traditional music” and allocating funds to support research on this art form. This support meant that most of the research in the field of Thai music from this time period was fundamental in nature and studied Thai music within the framework of Thai music theory. It examined the components of Thai music with a conservational approach following the prevailing understanding of “Thai traditional music.”""]"

Bioink serves as extracellular matrix providing structural support and guiding growth and development of tissue.

In this study, we investigated printability and cell compatibility of alginate-silk fibroin hydrogels for bioprinting. Different concentrations of SA-SF solution were tested for printability by pushing the mixture through needle and syringe. For Cell compatibility study, osteosarcoma were encapsulated in SA-SF hydrogel, determined cell viability using Live/dead and PrestoBlue™ assay. SA-SF hydrogel containing 1%(w/v) sodium alginate and 2% (w/v) silk fibroin successfully formed uniform strands and supported cell viability.

However, the lack of intrinsic bioactivity and rapid enzymatic degradation are main complications that limit its use as bone scaffolds. Herein, we developed a simple way to enhance bone bonding as well as long-term stability under physiological condition by crosslinking silk fibroin polypeptides with bioactive glass through GPTMS during sol-gel process. GPTMS provided many benefits to the developed organic-inorganic hybrid scaffolds. First, it prevented silk fibroin polypeptides from being leached out. While the uncrosslinked hybrid scaffolds submerged in protease solution suffered from 50 % weight loss within one day, it took 28 days for the GPTMS-crosslinked hybrid scaffolds to experience similar degradation level. Second, GPTMS crosslinking induced the formation of silk crystalline β-sheets and hence increased the compressive modulus of the hybrid scaffolds from 0.015 MPa to 3.122 MPa, which is close to that of the cancellous bone. Further, the hybrid scaffolds could induce crystallization of calcium phosphate under simulated body fluid, which resulted in greater SaOS-2 osteoblast proliferation on the hybrid scaffolds than silk fibroin or bioactive glass controls throughout 28-day cultivation. The cells on hybrid scaffolds also showed greater levels of osteogenic markers (alkaline phosphatase activity and calcium deposition) than those on silk fibroin scaffolds. This work therefore demonstrates that GPTMS crosslinking with bioactive glass during sol-gel process not only provided the hybrid scaffolds retarded enzymatic degradation and greater mechanical integrity.

Rat MSCs were encapsulated in 3 groups of hydrogel scaffolds (SF, SF with 0.05% collagen [SF/0.05C], and SF with 0.1% collagen [SF/0.1C]) and cultured in a growth medium and an osteogenic induction medium. DNA, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity, and calcium were assayed at periodically for up to 5 weeks. After 6 weeks of culture the cells were analyzed by scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive spectroscopy. Although SF hydrogel with collagen seems to have less efficiency to encapsulate rat MSCs, their plateau phase growth in all hydrogels was comparable. Inability to maintain cell viability as cell populations declined over 1-5 days was observed. Cell numbers then plateaued and were maintained until day 14 of culture. ALP activity and calcium content of rat MSCs in SF/collagen hydrogels were highest at day 21. An enhancing effect of collagen combined with the hydrogel was observed for proliferation and matrix formation; however, benefits of the combination on osteogenic differentiation and biomineralization are as yet unclear. Rat MSCs in SF and SF/collagen hydrogels showed osteogenic differentiation. Accordingly, these hydrogels may serve as promising scaffolds for bone tissue engineering.']"

This research aims at fabricating biodegradable fibers from poly (lactic acid) (PLA) blended with poly (butylene succinate) (PBS). PLA and PBS were blended in a twin-screw extruder at various PBS contents 0 to 20 wt%. The blended fibers were then prepared by the melt spinning using a multifilament spinneret. The mechanical, thermal, and morphological properties were characterized by tensile testing, differential scanning calorimetry, and scanning electron microscopy. The results indicate that, at PBS content in PLA of 10 wt%, the obtained fiber has the optimal tensile properties. At this ratio, the blends also possesses the highest crystallinity among the blended fibers. Although these two biodegradable polymers are immiscible, but at the optimal ratio the PBS phase is well-dispersed in the PLA matrix phase.', 'Preparation and Characteristics of Poly(butylene adipate-co-terephthalate)/Polylactide Blend Films via Synergistic Efficiency of Plasticization and Compatibilization  2018, Chinese Chemical Society, Institute of Chemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.Polylactide (PLA) films blended with poly(butylene adipate-co-terephthalate) (PBAT) were hot melted using a twin screw extruder with the addition of triethyl citrate (TEC) as a plasticizer and toluene diisocyanate (TDI) as a compatibilizer. The synergistic effects of the two additives on the mechanical, thermal, and morphological properties of the PLA/PBAT blend films were investigated. The influence of TEC content on the plasticized PLA films and the effect of TDI’s presence on the PLA/PBAT blend films were also studied by comparing them with neat PLA. The results showed a pronounced increase in elongation at break of the plasticized PLA films with increasing TEC levels, but a slight reduction in thermal stability. Also, the addition of TEC and TDI to the blend system not only synergistically enhanced the tensile properties and tensile-impact strength of the PLA/PBAT blends, but also affected their crystallinity and cold crystallization rate, a result of the improvement of interfacial interaction between PLA and PBAT, including the enhancement of their chain mobility. The synergy of the plasticization and compatibilization processes led to the improvement of tensile properties, tensile-impact strength, and compatibility of the blends, accelerating cold crystallization without affecting crystallization.']"

Published by IOS Press.BACKGROUND: Glutamate toxicity is involved in several neurodegenerative conditions, including Alzheimer's disease. OBJECTIVE: The study aims to investigate the neuroprotective efficacy of ethanol extract of Hibiscus sabdariffa calyces (HS) against glutamate-induced toxicity in HT-22 cells and anti-aging property in Caenorhabditis elegans. METHODS: HT-22 cells were pre-treated with HS followed by glutamate and evaluated for the neuroprotective effect using cell viability assay, confocal microscopic analysis, qPCR, Western blot, and docking analysis. Induction of anti-aging property in C. elegans with HS extract was analyzed through physiological assays and qPCR analysis. RESULTS: GC-MS analysis of the HS extract showed the presence of 19 compounds with antioxidant properties including oleamide, 2-(diethoxymethyl)furan and 5-methylfurfural. In vitro studies reveal that glutamate exerted toxicity in HT-22 cells by inducing oxidative stress, depleting glutathione, downregulating glutamate transporters, antioxidant genes, inducing autophagy (Beclin-1, Atg-5, Atg-7, LC3-II) by the activation of MAPK (p38, JNK) pathway, and causing apoptosis. However, pre-treatment with HS extract (5, 10μg/ml) reversed the effect and offered neuroprotection. In silico studies showed that the compounds of HS extract can bind effectively and inhibit the activity of NMDAR, calpain-1 and GSK-3β. In C. elegans, HS extended lifespan, reduced the accumulation of lipofuscin, modulated healthspan-related genes and downregulated the expression of daf-2. CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that HS with its bioactive components exhibits neuroprotective activity by upregulating glutamate transporters, inhibiting autophagy and exerts anti-aging property through DAF-16 dependent mechanism."", 'Anacardium Occidentale L.

Natural products, which have neuroprotective against oxidative stress and neurite outgrowth inducing activity, could be potential candidates for alternative treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. This study aims to investigate the neuroprotective effects and neuritogenesis properties of Anacardium occidentale leaf extracts in cultured neuronal (HT22 and Neuro-2a) cells. We found gallic acid, catechin and quercetin as the main compounds in A. occidentale extracts. The extracts have a protective effect against glutamate/H2O2-mediated oxidative stress-induced cell toxicity. The gene expression of cellular antioxidant enzymes (SODs, GPx and, GSTs) were up-regulated by this treatment. The treatment also triggered SIRT, Nrf2 proteins as well as the mRNA transcriptions of relevant anti-oxidation genes (NQO1, GCLM, and EAAT3). We demonstrated that the extracts promote antioxidant defense in neuronal cells via the SIRT1/Nrf2 signaling pathway. Moreover, the extracts increase neurite outgrowth and Ten-4 expression in Neuro-2a cells. However, the neuritogenesis properties did not occur, when Ten-4 expression was knocked down by corresponding siRNA. These results suggest that the leaf extracts have an interesting neuritogenesis and neuroprotective potential against glutamate/H2O2-mediated toxicity and could be a potential therapeutic candidate for neurodegenerative diseases.', 'Neuroprotective effects against glutamate-induced ht-22 hippocampal cell damage and caenorhabditis elegans lifespan/healthspan enhancing activity of auricularia polytricha mushroom extracts  2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.Oxidative stress is associated with several diseases, particularly neurodegenerative diseases, commonly found in the elderly. The attenuation of oxidative status is one of the alternatives for neuroprotection and anti-aging. Auricularia polytricha (AP), an edible mushroom, contains many therapeutic properties, including antioxidant properties. Herein, we report the effects of AP extracts on antioxidant, neuroprotective, and anti-aging activities. The neuroprotective effect of AP extracts against glutamate-induced HT-22 neuronal damage was determined by evaluating the cytotoxicity, intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation, and expression of antioxidant enzyme genes. Lifespan and healthspan assays were performed to examine the effects of AP extracts from Caenorhabditis elegans. We found that ethanolic extract (APE) attenuated glutamate-induced HT-22 cytotoxicity and increased the expression of antioxidant enzyme genes. Moreover, APE promoted in the longevity and health of the C. elegans. Chemical analysis of the extracts revealed that APE contains the highest quantity of flavonoids and a reasonable percentage of phenols. The lipophilic compounds in APE were identified by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS), revealing that APE mainly contains linoleic acid. Interestingly, linoleic acid suppressed neuronal toxicity and ROS accumulation from glutamate induction. These results indicate that AP could be an exciting natural source that may potentially serves as neuroprotective and anti-aging agents.']"

We postulate that women are more likely to have a milder degree of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and lower extent of hypoxia on Type III sleep studies versus polysomnography (PSG). Patients and methods: The Cleveland Clinic Sleep laboratory registry was leveraged to identify all adult inpatient sleep studies performed for OSA. Demographics, comorbidities, and sleep study measures were collected and compared by sex and sleep study type. Logistic regression was used to examine sleep study type predictive of OSA (apnea hypopnea index [AHI; ≥5, ≥15 and ≥ 30]) and hypoxia, (median percentage of sleep time spent at <90% SaO2 [TST<90%,≥ 11%,] adjusted for covariates. Results: The sample 778 patients had a mean age of 56.1 ± 16.1 years; 44.5% were female and 72.2% Caucasian. At an AHI≥5, women showed an increase odds of OSA (adjusted, OR = 2.04,95%; CI:1.24–3.35, p = 0.005) with Type III sleep study vs PSG compared to men. At an AHI≥15, men had less odds of OSA (adjusted OR = 0.60,95%CI:0.39–0.90,p = 0.015) with Type III sleep study vs PSG compared to women (OR = 1.15,95%CI:0.72–1.85,p = 0.56), with an interaction p-value of 0.040. These results were attenuated when the analysis was restricted using the 3% hypopnea scoring rule. Men and women had higher odds of TST <90 ≥ 11% (OR:2.60,95%CI:1.60–4.21,p=<0.001; OR:3.46,95%CI:1.97–6.05,p < 0.001) with Type III sleep study versus PSG, albeit no sex-interaction was observed. Conclusions: These results suggest that sex-specific differences in diagnostic performance of sleep testing type in the inpatient setting should be considered according to level of OSA severity, which are influenced by hypopnea-related desaturation extent.', 'Effects of two-week sleep extension on glucose metabolism in chronically sleep-deprived individuals  2019 American Academy of Sleep Medicine. All rights reserved.Study Objectives: Sleep deprivation is known to be associated with insulin resistance and diabetes risk. This study investigated whether 2-week sleep extension in chronically sleep-deprived individuals would improve glucose metabolism. Methods: A crossover study was conducted in volunteers without diabetes who reported sleeping ≤ 6 h/night. They were randomized to maintain their habitual sleep or extend sleep time for 2 weeks, then crossed over after a washout period. Sleep was monitored by actigraphy. Oral glucose tolerance tests (75 g) with insulin levels was performed at the end of each period. Mixed-effect linear regression analysis, adjusting for sequence and period effects, was applied. Results: A total of 21 participants (19 females) with mean (standard deviation) age of 33.1 (6.1) years completed the protocol. Mean sleep duration during habitual sleep was 318.7 (44.3) minutes and the participants extended their sleep by 36.0 (45.2) minutes during sleep extension. The average washout period was 21 (11) days. There were no significant effects of sleep extension on any metabolic parameters. The per-protocol analysis included eight participants who could sleep more than 6 hours during sleep extension (mean sleep duration 396 [25] minutes, extended by 60.1 [28.5] minutes). Among these individuals, sleep extension improved Homeostatic Model Assessment of Insulin Resistance (adjusted mean difference −0.50 [95% confidence interval [CI] −0.89, −0.11, P = .013]), early insulin secretion (insulinogenic index; mean difference 0.39 [95% CI 0.15, 0.63, P = .001]), and β-cell function (disposition index, mean difference 1.07 [95% CI 0.17, 1.97, P = .02]). Conclusions: Sleep extension in chronically sleep-deprived individuals improved glucose metabolism in only those who could objectively extend their sleep to more than 6 h/night. Our findings suggest that a critical amount of sleep is needed to benefit metabolic outcomes.', 'The relationship between diabetes-related complications and obstructive sleep apnea in type 2 diabetes Copyright  2018 Nantaporn Siwasaranond et al.This study explored the relationship between obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and the presence of any diabetes-related complications in type 2 diabetes and whether this was mediated by hypertension. Secondly, the relationship between OSA severity and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was investigated. A total of 131 patients participated. OSA was diagnosed using a home monitor, and severity was measured by apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) and oxygen desaturation index (ODI). OSA was found in 75.6% of the participants, 40.5% with moderate-to-severe degree. Any diabetes-related complications (retinopathy, neuropathy, nephropathy, or coronary artery disease) were present in 55.5%, and 70.2% of the participants had hypertension. Mediation analysis indicated that, compared to those with mild or no OSA, those with moderate-to-severe OSA were 3.05 times more likely to have any diabetesrelated complications and that this relationship was mediated by the presence of hypertension. After adjusting for confounders, ODI (B = -0.036, p = 0 041), but not AHI, was significantly associated with lower eGFR. In conclusion, moderate-to-severe OSA was related to the presence of any diabetes-related complications in type 2 diabetes, and the relationship was mediated by hypertension. The severity of intermittent hypoxia was associated with lower eGFR. Whether OSA treatment will delay or reduce diabetes-related complications should be investigated.']"

It is possible to detect postural stability using an integrated accelerometer (ACC) sensor in a smartphone. Therefore, a novel ACC-based smartphone application running on the Android operating system called BalanceLab was created and tested. Purpose: This study aimed to determine the validity and reliability of a novel ACC-based Android smartphone application for assessing balance in older adults. Methods: Using BalanceLab, 20 older adults completed three balance assessments: the Modified Clinical Test of Sensory Interaction in Balance (MCTSIB), a single-leg stance test (SLST), and a limit of stability test (LOS). The validity of this mobile application was investigated using a three-dimensional (3D) motion analysis system and the Fullerton Advanced Balance (FAB) scale. The test-retest reliability of this mobile application was determined on two separate occasions within one day, at least two hours apart. Results: The two static balance assessments (the MCTSIB and SLST) demonstrated moderate to excellent correlation with the 3D motion analysis system (r = 0.70–0.91) and the FAB scale (r = 0.67–0.80). However, the majority of the dynamic balance tests (the LOS tests) did not demonstrate any correlation with the 3D motion analysis system or the FAB scale. This novel ACC-based application demonstrated good to excellent test-retest reliability (ICC = 0.76–0.91).

The pathology of the neuromuscular control system in children with spastic diplegic cerebral palsy (SDCP) could contribute to atypical movement patterns leading to the inefficiency performance including the STS task. However, there was also a lack of evidence about kinematics, kinetics, and especially mechanical work during the STS task in children with SDCP aged 7–12 years old. Research question: What were the differences in mechanical work, kinematics and kinetics during STS task between children with SDCP and typically developing (TD) children? Methods: Eleven children with SDCP (GMFCS I-II) and eleven age and gender-matched control TD children with an age range of 7–12 years were enrolled. Motion analysis and force plate systems were used to collect data. All participants performed the STS task from an adjustable chair. Independent sample t-test and two-way analysis of variance were used in this study. Results: The children with SDCP took a longer time and used more mechanical work during STS than TD children. At the beginning of the STS task, children with SDCP showed more trunk flexion and posterior pelvic tilting; in addition, during the STS task they also presented more trunk, hip, and knee flexion than TD children. However, the children with SDCP showed less ankle dorsiflexion compared with TD children. For the kinetic variables, asymmetry was found in children with SDCP. The maximum hip and knee extension moment, plantar flexion moment, and peak vertical ground reaction force (GRF) of the non-dominant leg were higher than the values of the dominant leg in these children. Significance: Even though, children with SDCP who are able to independently STS. They were also a mechanically less efficient performance during STS task.

Also, visual feedback during motor learning is important in facilitating efficient postural responses and balance skills. In this study, a custom-made visual feedback device was invented to provide the training modality and program based on single-leg standing combined with augmented visual feedback training. This study aimed to investigate the effects of visual feedback training using the custom-made visual feedback device on balance and functional lower-extremity strength in older adults. Methods: Thirty-four independent older adults were randomly allocated to a training group (TG) and a control group (CG). The participants in the TG received training with the custom-made visual feedback device. The training duration was three sessions per week, for four weeks. The participants in the CG continued their routine activities. Balance (static and dynamic balances, and balance confidence) and functional lower-extremity strength were assessed pre- and post-training. Results: Improvements in static balance (sway velocity and limit of balance during one-leg standing with eyes open) and dynamic balance (directional control of limits of stability in the backward direction) were found after training in the TG compared with the CG. No significant differences in balance confidence or functional lower-extremity strength were found between groups after training. Conclusion: In older adults, training with a custom-made visual feedback device could be used to improve both static and dynamic balances, but not balance confidence and functional lower-extremity strength.']"

Published by American Chemical Society.Natural kaolin-based Ni catalysts have been developed for low-temperature CO2 methanation. The catalysts were prepared via a one-step co-impregnation of Ni and Ce onto a natural kaolin-derived metakaolin using a microwave-assisted hydrothermal method as an acid-/base-free synthesis method. The influences of microwave irradiation and Ce promotion on the catalytic enhancement including the CO2 conversion, CH4 selectivity, and CH4 yield were experimentally investigated by a catalytic test of as-prepared catalysts in a fixed-bed tubular reactor. The relationship between the catalyst properties and its methanation activities was revealed by various characterization techniques including X-ray fluorescence, X-ray diffraction, Brunauer-Emmett-Teller, scanning electron microscopy, selected area electron diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, elemental mapping, H2 temperature-programmed reduction, and X-ray absorption near-edge structure analyses. Among the two enhancement methods, microwave and Ce promotion, the microwave-assisted synthesis could produce a catalyst containing highly dispersed Ni particles with a smaller Ni crystallite size and higher catalyst reducibility, resulting in a higher CO2 conversion from 1.6 to 7.5% and a better CH4 selectivity from 76.3 to 79.9% at 300 °C. Meanwhile, the enhancement by Ce addition exhibited a great improvement on the catalyst activities. It was experimentally found that the CO2 conversion increased approximately 7-fold from 7.5 to 52.9%, while the CH4 selectivity significantly improved from 79.9 to 98.0% at 300 °C. Though the microwave-assisted synthesis could further improve the catalyst activities of Ce-promoted catalysts, the Ce addition exhibited a more prominent impact than the microwave enhancement. Cerium oxide (CeO2) improved the catalyst activities through mechanisms of higher CO2 adsorption capacity with its basic sites and the unique structure of CeO2 with a reversible valence change of Ce4+ and Ce3+ and high oxygen vacancies. However, it was found that the catalyst prepared by microwave-assisted synthesis and Ce promotion proved to be the optimum catalyst in this study. Therefore, the present work demonstrated the potential to synthesize a nickel-based catalyst with improved catalytic activities by adding a small amount of Ce as a catalytic promoter and employing microwave irradiation for improving the Ni dispersion.', 'Catalytic performance of Ni/CeO2 catalysts prepared from different routes for CO2 methanation  2021 Taiwan Institute of Chemical EngineersIn thid study, Ni/CeO2 catalysts were prepared by a one-step co-precipitation of nickel and cerium salts in a NaOH solution treated by different heating methods including microwave (MW), hydrothermal (HM) and evaporation (EP). With TEM observation, the co-precipitation provided the catalysts containing a highly crystalline CeO2 of a (111) plane structure with d-spacing of 3.15–3.24 Å. The obtained CeO2 nanoparticles exhibited a pseudo-spherical shape with a size range of 10.8–12.1 nm. Based on HR-TEM analyses, NiO nanoparticles with a large size range of 48.8–51.2 nm were found to be incorporated within the CeO2 nanostructure. By N2 sorption measurement, all Ni/CeO2 catalysts possessed a mesoporous characteristic with a specific surface area range of 70.5–75.7 m2/g and an average pore diameter of 30 nm. XRD results revealed that NiO species could be completely transformed into Ni0 species by the H2 reduction process. XPS analyses further confirmed the presence of Ni0 species with a prominent peak at an energy bandgap of 852.6 eV. Hydrogen temperature-programmed reduction (H2-TPR) confirmed that α and β peaks of NiO species were completely reduced at a temperature lower than 500 °C. The Ni/CeO2 catalyst prepared by MW method exhibited a higher strong metal-support interaction (SMSI) between Ni and CeO2 revealed by H2 consumption results. The Ni/CeO2 catalysts prepared by MW, HM, EP methods exhibited the CO2 methanation activity with TOF of 13.6, 10.8 and 5.8 s−1, which could be correlated with the Ni crystallite sizes of 42.2, 50.5 and 52.8 nm, respectively. All prepared Ni/CeO2 catalysts exhibited the stable catalytic performances with a negligible drop in CO2 conversion and CH4 selectivity over 72 h-time-on-stream test. In comparison, the MW method with a rapid and uniform heating under autogenous pressure could result in the Ni/CeO2 catalyst with the superior catalytic activities due to the higher dispersion of Ni.', 'Catalytic performance of Ni catalysts supported on CeO2 with different morphologies for low-temperature CO2 methanation  2020 Elsevier B.V.In this study, a series of Ni catalysts supported on CeO2 with different morphologies including nanopolyhedrons (PH), nanorods (NR), nanoparticles (NP) and nanocubes (NC) was prepared via hydrothermal / wet impregnation method. The catalytic performance of as-prepared catalysts was evaluated for low-temperature CO2 methanation. The Ni/CeO2 catalysts exhibited a superior CO2 conversion and CH4 selectivity over METH®134, a commercial methanation catalyst. The following order of activity was experimentally found: Ni/CeO2-PH > Ni/CeO2-NR > Ni/CeO2-NP > Ni/CeO2-NC > METH®134. Among different CeO2 morphologies, the Ni/CeO2-NR catalyst exhibited the largest surface area and the highest reducibility, providing the high oxygen vacancies/oxygen storage capacity (OSC). Nevertheless, the strong metal-support interaction (SMSI) between Ni and Ce of the Ni/CeO2-NR catalyst determined by H2-TPR posed a negative impact on the CO2 conversion at low temperature. Unexpectedly, the Ni/CeO2-PH catalyst possessed a single crystalline CeO2 nanostructure of ca. 7.4 nm with relatively high surface area and high reducibility especially at low reduction temperature. Therefore, the Ni/CeO2-PH catalyst was found to be the optimum catalyst for low-temperature CO2 methanation.']"

This systematic review aimed to assess the effects of double-dose INCS. Methods: Literature searches were performed using MEDLINE and EMBASE. Randomized controlled trials that studied the effects of double-dose INCS vs standard-dose INCS for treating patients with AR were included. Data from the included studies were extracted and collected for meta-analyses. The outcomes were nasal symptoms, ocular symptoms, and adverse events. Results: Twelve studies (4166 patients) met the inclusion criteria. There were 5 pediatric studies (1868 patients), 5 adult studies (1414 patients), and 2 studies with mixed populations (884 patients).

Adverse events between groups were not different.', ""Biologics for chronic rhinosinusitis Copyright  2021 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.Background: This living systematic review is one of several Cochrane Reviews evaluating the medical management of patients with chronic rhinosinusitis. Chronic rhinosinusitis is common. It is characterised by inflammation of the nasal and sinus linings, nasal blockage, rhinorrhoea, facial pressure/pain and loss of sense of smell. It occurs with or without nasal polyps. 'Biologics' are medicinal products produced by a biological process. Monoclonal antibodies are one type, already evaluated in other inflammatory conditions (e.g. asthma and atopic dermatitis). Objectives: To assess the effects of biologics for the treatment of chronic rhinosinusitis. Search methods: The Cochrane ENT Information Specialist searched the Cochrane ENT Register; CENTRAL (2020, Issue 9); Ovid MEDLINE; Ovid Embase; Web of Science; ClinicalTrials.gov; ICTRP and additional sources for published and unpublished studies. The date of the search was 28 September 2020. Selection criteria: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with at least three months follow-up comparing biologics (monoclonal antibodies) against placebo/no treatment in patients with chronic rhinosinusitis. Data collection and analysis: We used standard Cochrane methodological procedures. Our primary outcomes were disease-specific health-related quality of life (HRQL), disease severity and serious adverse events (SAEs). The secondary outcomes were avoidance of surgery, extent of disease (measured by endoscopic or computerised tomography (CT) score), generic HRQL and adverse effects (nasopharyngitis, including sore throat). We used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence for each outcome. Main results: We included 10 studies. Of 1262 adult participants, 1260 had severe chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps; 43% to 100% of participants also had asthma. Three biologics, with different targets, were evaluated: dupilumab, mepolizumab and omalizumab. All of the studies were sponsored or supported by industry. For this update (2021) we have included two new studies, including 265 participants, which reported data relating to omalizumab. Anti-IL-4Rα mAb (dupilumab) versus placebo/no treatment (all receiving intranasal steroids). Three studies (784 participants) evaluated dupilumab. Disease-specific HRQL was measured with the SNOT-22 (a 22-item questionnaire, with a score range of 0 to 110; minimal clinically important difference (MCID) 8.9 points). At 24 weeks, dupilumab results in a large reduction (improvement) in the SNOT-22 score (mean difference (MD) -19.61, 95% confidence interval (CI) -22.54 to -16.69; 3 studies; 784 participants; high certainty). At between 16 and 52 weeks of follow-up, dupilumab probably results in a large reduction in disease severity, as measured by a 0- to 10-point visual analogue scale (VAS) (MD -3.00, 95% CI -3.47 to -2.53; 3 studies; 784 participants; moderate certainty). This is a global symptom score, including all aspects of chronic rhinosinusitis symptoms. At between 16 and 52 weeks of follow-up, dupilumab may result in a reduction in serious adverse events compared to placebo (5.9% versus 12.5%, risk ratio (RR) 0.47, 95% CI 0.29 to 0.76; 3 studies, 782 participants; low certainty). Anti-IL-5 mAb (mepolizumab) versus placebo/no treatment (all receiving intranasal steroids). Two studies (137 participants) evaluated mepolizumab. Disease-specific HRQL was measured with the SNOT-22. At 25 weeks, the SNOT-22 score may be reduced (improved) in participants receiving mepolizumab (MD -13.26 points, 95% CI -22.08 to -4.44; 1 study; 105 participants; low certainty; MCID 8.9). It is very uncertain whether there is a difference in disease severity at 25 weeks: on a 0- to 10-point VAS, disease severity was -2.03 lower in those receiving mepolizumab (95% CI -3.65 to -0.41; 1 study; 72 participants; very low certainty). It is very uncertain if there is a difference in the number of serious adverse events at between 25 and 40 weeks (1.4% versus 0%; RR 1.57, 95% CI 0.07 to 35.46; 2 studies; 135 participants, very low certainty). Anti-IgE mAb (omalizumab) versus placebo/no treatment (all receiving intranasal steroids). Five studies (329 participants) evaluated omalizumab. Disease-specific HRQL was measured with the SNOT-22. At 24 weeks omalizumab probably results in a large reduction in SNOT-22 score (MD -15.62, 95% CI -19.79 to -11.45; 2 studies; 265 participants; moderate certainty; MCID 8.9). We did not identify any evidence for overall disease severity. It is very uncertain whether omalizumab affects the number of serious adverse events, with follow-up between 20 and 26 weeks (0.8% versus 2.5%, RR 0.32, 95% CI 0.05 to 2.00; 5 studies; 329 participants; very low certainty). Authors' conclusions: Almost all of the participants in the included studies had nasal polyps (99.8%) and all were using topical nasal steroids for their chronic rhinosinusitis symptoms. In these patients, dupilumab improves disease-specific HRQL compared to placebo. It probably also results in a reduction in disease severity, and may result in a reduction in the number of serious adverse events. Mepolizumab may improve disease-specific HRQL. It is very uncertain if there is a difference in disease severity or the number of serious adverse events. Omalizumab probably improves disease-specific HRQL compared to placebo. It is very uncertain if there is a difference in the number of serious adverse events. There was no evidence regarding the effect of omalizumab on disease severity (using global scores that address all symptoms of chronic rhinosinusitis)."", ""Saline irrigation for allergic rhinitis  2018 The Cochrane Collaboration.Background: Allergic rhinitis is a common condition affecting both adults and children. Patients experience symptoms of nasal obstruction, rhinorrhoea, sneezing and nasal itching, which may affect their quality of life. Nasal irrigation with saline (salty water), also known as nasal douching, washing or lavage, is a procedure that rinses the nasal cavity with isotonic or hypertonic saline solutions. It can be performed with low positive pressure from a spray, pump or squirt bottle, with a nebuliser or with gravity-based pressure in which the person instils saline into one nostril and allows it to drain out of the other. Saline solutions are available over the counter and can be used alone or as an adjunct to other therapies. Objectives: To evaluate the effects of nasal saline irrigation in people with allergic rhinitis. Search methods: The Cochrane ENT Information Specialist searched the ENT Trials Register; CENTRAL; Ovid MEDLINE; Ovid Embase; CINAHL; Web of Science; ClinicalTrials.gov; ICTRP and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the search was 23 November 2017. Selection criteria: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing nasal saline irrigation, delivered by any means and with any volume, tonicity and alkalinity, with (a) no nasal saline irrigation or (b) other pharmacological treatments in adults and children with allergic rhinitis. We included studies comparing nasal saline versus no saline, where all participants also received pharmacological treatment (intranasal corticosteroids or oral antihistamines). Data collection and analysis: We used the standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Primary outcomes were patient-reported disease severity and a common adverse effect - epistaxis. Secondary outcomes were disease-specific health-related quality of life (HRQL), individual symptom scores, general HRQL, the adverse effects of local irritation or discomfort, ear symptoms (pain or pressure) and nasal endoscopy scores. We used GRADE to assess the quality of the evidence for each outcome; this is indicated in italics. Main results: We included 14 studies (747 participants). The studies included children (seven studies, 499 participants) and adults (seven studies, 248 participants). No studies reported outcomes beyond three months follow-up. Saline volumes ranged from 'very low' to 'high' volume. Where stated, studies used either hypertonic or isotonic saline solution. Nasal saline versus no saline treatment All seven studies (112 adults; 332 children) evaluating this comparison used different scoring systems for patient-reported disease severity, so we pooled the data using the standardised mean difference (SMD). Saline irrigation may improve patient-reported disease severity compared with no saline at up to four weeks (SMD -1.32, 95% confidence interval (CI) -1.84 to -0.81; 407 participants; 6 studies; low quality) and between four weeks and three months (SMD -1.44, 95% CI -2.39 to -0.48; 167 participants; 5 studies; low quality). Although the evidence was low quality the SMD values at both time points are considered large effect sizes. Subgroup analysis showed the improvement in both adults and children. Subgroup analyses for volume and tonicity were inconclusive due to heterogeneity. Two studies reported methods for recording adverse effects and five studies mentioned them. Two studies (240 children) reported no adverse effects (epistaxis or local discomfort) in either group and three only reported no adverse effects in the saline group. One study (48 children) reported disease-specific HRQL using a modified RCQ-36 scale. It was uncertain whether there was a difference between the groups at any of the specified time points (very low quality). No other secondary outcomes were reported. Nasal saline versus no saline with adjuvant use of intranasal steroids or oral antihistamines Three studies (40 adults; 79 children) compared saline with intranasal steroids versus intranasal steroids alone; one study (14 adults) compared saline with oral antihistamines versus oral antihistamines alone. It is uncertain if there is a difference in patient-reported disease severity at up to four weeks (SMD -0.60, 95% CI -1.34 to 0.15; 32 participants; 2 studies; very low quality) or from four weeks to three months (SMD -0.32, 95% CI -0.85 to 0.21; 58 participants; 2 studies; very low quality). Although none of the studies reported methods for recording adverse effects, three mentioned them: one study (40 adults; adjuvant intranasal steroids) reported no adverse effects (epistaxis or local discomfort) in either group; the other two only reported no adverse effects in the saline group. It is uncertain if saline irrigation in addition to pharmacological treatment improved disease-specific HRQL at four weeks to three months, compared with pharmacological treatment alone (SMD -1.26, 95% CI -2.47 to -0.05; 54 participants; 2 studies; very low quality). No other secondary outcomes were reported. Nasal saline versus intranasal steroids It is uncertain if there was a difference in patient-reported disease severity between nasal saline and intranasal steroids at up to four weeks (MD 1.06, 95% CI -1.65 to 3.77; 14 participants; 1 study), or between four weeks and three months (SMD 1.26, 95% CI -0.92 to 3.43; 97 participants; 3 studies), or indisease-specific HRQL between four weeks and three months (SMD 0.01, 95% CI -0.73 to 0.75; 83 participants; 2 studies). Only one study reported methods for recording adverse effects although three studies mentioned them. One (21 participants) reported two withdrawals due to adverse effects but did not describe these or state which group. Three studies reported no adverse effects (epistaxis or local discomfort) with saline, although one study reported that 27% of participants experienced local discomfort with steroid use. No other secondary outcomes were reported. Authors' conclusions: Saline irrigation may reduce patient-reported disease severity compared with no saline irrigation at up to three months in both adults and children with allergic rhinitis, with no reported adverse effects. No data were available for any outcomes beyond three months. The overall quality of evidence was low or very low. The included studies were generally small and used a range of different outcome measures to report disease severity scores, with unclear validation. This review did not include direct comparisons of saline types (e.g. different volume, tonicity). Since saline irrigation could provide a cheap, safe and acceptable alternative to intranasal steroids and antihistamines further high-quality, adequately powered research in this area is warranted.""]"

Atomistic insights into the inhibitory mechanisms  2020 American Chemical SocietySince the emergence of a novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was first reported from Wuhan, China, neither a specific vaccine nor an antiviral drug against SARS-CoV-2 has become available. However, a combination of two HIV-1 protease inhibitors, lopinavir and ritonavir, has been found to be effective against SARS-CoV, and both drugs could bind well to the SARS-CoV 3C-like protease (SARS-CoV 3CLpro). In this work, molecular complexation between each inhibitor and SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro was studied using all-atom molecular dynamics simulations, free energy calculations, and pair interaction energy analyses based on MM/PB(GB)SA and FMO-MP2/PCM/6-31G* methods. Both anti-HIV drugs interacted well with the residues at the active site of SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro. Ritonavir showed a somewhat higher number atomic contacts, a somewhat higher binding efficiency, and a somewhat higher number of key binding residues compared to lopinavir, which correspond with the slightly lower water accessibility at the 3CLpro active site. In addition, only ritonavir could interact with the oxyanion hole residues N142 and G143 via the formation of two hydrogen bonds. The interactions in terms of electrostatics, dispersion, and charge transfer played an important role in the drug binding. The obtained results demonstrated how repurposed anti-HIV drugs could be used to combat COVID-19.', ""Discovery of C-12 dithiocarbamate andrographolide analogues as inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 main protease: In vitro and in silico studies  2022 The Author(s)A global crisis of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has impacted millions of people's lives throughout the world. In parallel to vaccine development, identifying potential antiviral agents against SARS-CoV-2 has become an urgent need to combat COVID-19. One of the most attractive drug targets for discovering anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents is the main protease (Mpro), which plays a pivotal role in the viral life cycle. This study aimed to elucidate a series of twenty-one 12-dithiocarbamate-14-deoxyandrographolide analogues as SARS-CoV-2 Mpro inhibitors using in vitro and in silico studies. These compounds were initially screened for the inhibitory activity toward SARS-CoV-2 Mpro by in vitro enzyme-based assay. We found that compounds 3k, 3l, 3m and 3t showed promising inhibitory activity against SARS-CoV-2 Mpro with >50% inhibition at 10 μM. Afterward, the binding mode of each compound in the active site of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro was explored by molecular docking. The optimum docked complexes were then chosen and subjected to molecular dynamic (MD) simulations. The MD results suggested that all studied complexes were stable along the simulation time, and most of the compounds could fit well with the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro active site, particularly at S1, S2 and S4 subsites. The per-residue decomposition free energy calculations indicated that the hot-spot residues essential for ligand binding were T25, H41, C44, S46, M49, C145, H163, M165, E166, L167, D187, R188, Q189 and T190. Therefore, the obtained information from the combined experimental and computational techniques could lead to further optimization of more specific and potent andrographolide analogues toward SARS-CoV-2 Mpro."", 'Molecular modelling investigation for drugs and nutraceuticals against protease of SARS-CoV-2  2020 Elsevier Inc.The widespread problem of a 2019-novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) strain outbreak in Wuhan, China has prompted a search for new drugs to protect against and treat this disease. It is necessary to immediately investigate this due to the mutation of the viral genome and there being no current protective vaccines or therapeutic drugs. Molecular modelling and molecular docking based on in silico screening strategies were employed to determine the potential activities of seven HIV protease (HIV-PR) inhibitors, two flu drugs, and eight natural compounds. The computational approach was carried out to discover the structural modes with a high binding affinity for these drugs on the homology structure of the Wuhan coronavirus protease (SARS-CoV-2 PR). From the theoretical calculations, all the drugs and natural compounds demonstrated various favorable binding affinities. An interesting finding was that the natural compounds tested had a higher potential binding activity with the pocket sites of SARS-CoV-2 PR compared to the groups of HIV-PR inhibitors. The binding modes of each complex illustrated between the drugs and compounds interacted with the functional group of amino acids in the binding pocket via hydrophilic, hydrophobic, and hydrogen bond interactions using the molecular dynamics simulation technique. This result supports the idea that existing protease inhibitors and natural compounds could be used to treat the new coronavirus. This report sought to provide fundamental knowledge as preliminary experimental data to propose an existing nutraceutical material against viral infection. Collectively, it is suggested that molecular modelling and molecular docking are suitable tools to search and screen for new drugs and natural compounds that can be used as future treatments for viral diseases.']"

However, there is no universally accepted method of measuring this outcome in clinical trials. Methods: We convened an online consensus workshop to establish a core outcome measure for PD-related peritonitis in clinical trials. Results: A total of 53 participants, including 18 patients and caregivers, from 12 countries engaged in breakout discussions in this workshop. Transcripts were analyzed thematically. We identified the following 3 themes: (i) feasibility and applicability across diverse settings, which reflected the difficulty with implementing laboratory-based measures in resource-limited environments; (ii) ensuring validity, which included minimizing false positives and considering the specificity of symptoms; and (iii) being meaningful and tangible to patients, which meant that the measure should be easy to interpret, reflect the impact that symptoms have on patients, and promote transparency by standardizing the reporting of peritonitis among dialysis units. Conclusion: A core outcome measure for PD-related peritonitis should include both symptom-based and laboratory-based criteria. Thus, the International Society for Peritoneal Dialysis (ISPD) definition of peritonitis is acceptable. However, there should be consideration of reporting suspected peritonitis in cases where laboratory confirmation is not possible. The measure should include all infections from the time of catheter insertion and capture both the rate of infection and the number of patients who remain peritonitis free. A core outcome measure with these features would increase the impact of clinical trials on the care and decision-making of patients receiving PD.', 'Peritoneal Dialysis–Related Infection Rates and Outcomes: Results From the Peritoneal Dialysis Outcomes and Practice Patterns Study (PDOPPS)  2019 The AuthorsRationale & Objective: Peritoneal dialysis (PD)-related peritonitis carries high morbidity for PD patients. Understanding the characteristics and risk factors for peritonitis can guide regional development of prevention strategies. We describe peritonitis rates and the associations of selected facility practices with peritonitis risk among countries participating in the Peritoneal Dialysis Outcomes and Practice Patterns Study (PDOPPS). Study Design: Observational prospective cohort study. Setting & Participants: 7,051 adult PD patients in 209 facilities across 7 countries (Australia, New Zealand, Canada, Japan, Thailand, United Kingdom, United States). Exposures: Facility characteristics (census count, facility age, nurse to patient ratio) and selected facility practices (use of automated PD, use of icodextrin or biocompatible PD solutions, antibiotic prophylaxis strategies, duration of PD training). Outcomes: Peritonitis rate (by country, overall and variation across facilities), microbiology patterns. Analytical Approach: Poisson rate estimation, proportional rate models adjusted for selected patient case-mix variables. Results: 2,272 peritonitis episodes were identified in 7,051 patients (crude rate, 0.28 episodes/patient-year). Facility peritonitis rates were variable within each country and exceeded 0.50/patient-year in 10% of facilities. Overall peritonitis rates, in episodes per patient-year, were 0.40 (95% CI, 0.36-0.46) in Thailand, 0.38 (95% CI, 0.32-0.46) in the United Kingdom, 0.35 (95% CI, 0.30-0.40) in Australia/New Zealand, 0.29 (95% CI, 0.26-0.32) in Canada, 0.27 (95% CI, 0.25-0.30) in Japan, and 0.26 (95% CI, 0.24-0.27) in the United States. The microbiology of peritonitis was similar across countries, except in Thailand, where Gram-negative infections and culture-negative peritonitis were more common. Facility size was positively associated with risk for peritonitis in Japan (rate ratio [RR] per 10 patients, 1.07; 95% CI, 1.04-1.09). Lower peritonitis risk was observed in facilities that had higher automated PD use (RR per 10 percentage points greater, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.91-1.00), facilities that used antibiotics at catheter insertion (RR, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.69-0.99), and facilities with PD training duration of 6 or more (vs <6) days (RR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.68-0.96). Lower peritonitis risk was seen in facilities that used topical exit-site mupirocin or aminoglycoside ointment, but this association did not achieve conventional levels of statistical significance (RR, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.62-1.01). Limitations: Sampling variation, selection bias (rate estimates), and residual confounding (associations). Conclusions: Important international differences exist in the risk for peritonitis that may result from varied and potentially modifiable treatment practices. These findings may inform future guidelines in potentially setting lower maximally acceptable peritonitis rates.', 'Variation in Peritoneal Dialysis Time on Therapy by Country Results from the Peritoneal Dialysis Outcomes and Practice Patterns Study  2022 by the American Society of Nephrology.Background and objectives Quantifying contemporary peritoneal dialysis time on therapy is important for patients and providers.We describe time on peritoneal dialysis in the context of outcomes of hemodialysis transfer, death, and kidney transplantation on the basis of the multinational, observational Peritoneal Dialysis Outcomes and Practice Patterns Study (PDOPPS) from 2014 to 2017. Design, setting, participants, & measurements Among 218 randomly selected peritoneal dialysis facilities (7121 patients) in the PDOPPS from Australia/New Zealand, Canada, Japan, Thailand, the United Kingdom, and the United States, we calculated the cumulative incidence from peritoneal dialysis start to hemodialysis transfer, death, or kidney transplantation over 5 years and adjusted hazard ratios for patient and facility factors associated with death and hemodialysis transfer. Results Median time on peritoneal dialysis ranged from 1.7 (interquartile range, 0.8–2.9; the United Kingdom) to 3.2 (interquartile range, 1.5–6.0; Japan) years and was longer with lower kidney transplantation rates (range: 32% [the United Kingdom] to 2% [Japan and Thailand] over 3 years). Adjusted hemodialysis transfer risk was lowest in Thailand, but death risk was higher in Thailand and the United States compared with most countries. Infection was the leading cause of hemodialysis transfer, with higher hemodialysis transfer risks seen in patients having psychiatric disorder history or elevated body mass index. The proportion of patients with total weekly Kt/V ≥1.7 at a facility was not associated with death or hemodialysis transfer. Conclusions Countries in the PDOPPS with higher rates of kidney transplantation tended to have shorter median times on peritoneal dialysis. Identification of infection as a leading cause of hemodialysis transfer and patient and facility factors associated with the risk of hemodialysis transfer can facilitate interventions to reduce these events.']"

All rights reserved.Fly ash is a ubiquitously used pozzolan in cementitious material. Its technical knowledge has been widely studied for several decades and seems very well-established. However, a practical challenge currently exists. Different fly ash, even in different batches produced from similar power plant, has a wide variation of properties. To better control the wide variation of properties, this study aims to assess the effects of cementitious mixtures containing different fly ash properties (degree of fineness and CaO content) on heat release, flow, compressive strength, chloride ion penetration resistance, and carbonation resistance. Results from statistical analysis of 270 tested data of fly ash in various ASEAN countries indicate that the fineness of fly ash particle influences on the compressive strength, chloride ion penetration resistance, and carbonation resistance. Whereas, the CaO content of fly ash only statistically impacts on the compressive strength, but not on the chloride ion penetration resistance and carbonation resistance. To reduce the current practical challenge of the wide variation of cement–fly ash composite properties, their durability properties can be improved by adding smaller fly ash particle in cement system. The control of fly ash production by delivering its optimal degree of fineness is more important than selecting the optimal CaO content of fly ash. The study offers a deep technical value differentiating between effects of its fineness and CaO content such that the fly ash producers and consumers can realize and offer the optimized fly ash for good product quality.', 'Effect of Oil Palm Fiber Content on the Physical and Mechanical Properties and Microstructure of High-Calcium Fly Ash Geopolymer Paste  2018, King Fahd University of Petroleum & Minerals.This paper investigates the effect of oil palm fiber content on the physical and mechanical properties and microstructure of high-calcium fly ash geopolymer paste. The oil palm fiber was added to the mixture at 0, 1, 2, and 3% by weight of fly ash. Sodium hydroxide (NaOH) and sodium silicate (Na 2SiO 3) were used as liquid alkaline activators. The bulk density, compressive strength, flexural strength, pore size distribution, scanning electron microscopy, and thermal conductivity of geopolymer paste were determined. Test results showed that the bulk density of high-calcium geopolymer paste containing oil palm fibers decreased with increasing fiber content. The increase oil palm fiber content decreased the compressive strength of geopolymer paste but enhanced the flexural strength and toughness and changed the failure behavior of geopolymer composite. In addition, the pore size and total porosity also increased with the increase in fiber content, while the thermal conductivity was reduced. The addition of oil palm fiber can improve the flexural strength and thermal conductivity of geopolymer paste and could thus be developed into a fiber-reinforced composite for construction purposes.', 'Geopolymer synthesis using metakaolin and high calcium fly ash as binary system geopolymer  2020 Trans Tech Publications Ltd, Switzerland.Conventional cement production process emits tons of carbon dioxide gas which is one of the greenhouse gases that influence the environment across the world. Discovering the alternative construction material with the eco-friendly process and the performance similar to or greater than ordinary Portland cement has been attractive to find out. This research presented green construction materials or so-called geopolymers from metakaolin substituted by high calcium fly ash by 20, 40, 60, 80 and 100 wt%. Some researches reported that geopolymer produced from metakaolin and fly ash with alkali solution gave a great result, but usually, they used fly ash containing very low calcium component. Compressive strength at 3, 7 and 28 curing days and flowability were conducted. The compressive strength of geopolymers blended with high calcium fly ash was still developed as the curing day increased and revealed the highest at 28 days especially on MK40 (high calcium fly ash 60 wt%). Geopolymer pastes prepared with a higher amount of high calcium fly ash exhibited less viscous. It was proved that the high amount of high calcium fly ash could be applied and gave extraordinary compressive strength. Furthermore, X-ray diffraction and X-ray fluorescence were used to investigate chemical properties as well as microstructure by a scanning electron microscope. For phase analysis, the existence of oxides of calcium and sulfur in high calcium fly ash resulted in the formation of thenardite, calcite, portlandite and C-S-H phase associating with geopolymeric phase. Therefore, this research proposed the opportunity for geopolymer production by using abundant high calcium fly ash to raise the value of the industrial waste products and green alternative construction material compared with OPC.']"

RD43 rice flour demonstrated an irregular and polyhedral shape with a volume mean diameter of 103 ± 0.15 µm. In addition, the amylose content of RD43 rice and Hom Mali rice flour was 19.04% and 16.38%, respectively. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Fourier Transforms Infrared (FTIR) confirmed the presence of a V-type crystalline structure and less crystallinity in RD43 rice flour, which resulted in a significant reduction of the water absorption index (WAI), swelling power (SP), water solubility index (WSI), gelatinization temperature, and pasting properties. Comparing with Hom Mali rice flour, RD43 rice flour had greater ability to disrupt cholesterol micellization and bind bile acid. Furthermore, it had lower starch digestibility, with a lower percentage of rapidly digestible starch (RDS) and higher percentage of undigestible starch than Hom Mali rice flour. Moreover, steamed muffins based on RD43 rice flour had lower starch digestibility than Hom Mali steamed muffins. The sensory analysis showed no significant differences between Hom Mali and RD43 steamed muffins. The findings suggest that RD43 rice flour could be an alternative ingredient for lowering the glycemic index of food products.', 'Postprandial glycemia, insulinemia, and antioxidant status in healthy subjects after ingestion of bread made from anthocyanin-rich riceberry rice  2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.Riceberry rice, a gluten-free grain, contains many nutrient components, including carbohydrates, proteins, certain fatty acids, and micronutrients, as well as bioactive non-nutrient compounds, such as polyphenolic compounds. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of bread made from anthocyanin-rich Riceberry rice on the postprandial glycemic response, glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), antioxidant status, and subjective ratings of appetite. In the crossover design, 16 healthy participants (six men and 10 women) completed four sessions involving blood collection in the fasting state and at 30, 60, 90, 120, 150, and 180 min after food consumption (50 g of available carbohydrate) in a randomized order: 1) glucose solution, 2) wheat bread (WB), 3) Riceberry rice bread (RRB), and 4) Hom Mali bread (HMB). Consumption of RRB resulted in significantly lower postprandial plasma glucose concentration at 30 and 60 min when compared to HMB. No difference in postprandial glucose concentration between RRB and WB was observed. In addition, postprandial plasma insulin showed a significant decrease in the group which received RRB at 15 and 60 min, as compared to HMB. In comparison with 50 g of glucose, as a reference, the glycemic index (GI) of RRB, WB, and HMB was 69.3 ± 4.4, 77.8 ± 4.6, and 130.6 ± 7.9, respectively. Interestingly, the ferric-reducing ability of plasma (FRAP) level was shown to significantly increase after consumption of RRB. In the meantime, a significant decrease in the postprandial FRAP level was also observed following an intake of WB and HMB. All breads caused increases in the postprandial plasma protein thiol group and had similar effects on hunger, fullness, desire to eat, and satiety ratings. However, consumption of RBB, WB, and HMB did not change plasma GLP-1 and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels when compared to the baseline.

The antioxidant activities, contents of total flavonoids and phenolic compounds in the ethanolic rice husk extract were evaluated. The highest antioxidant activities were found in the variety PES1CMU, with 2,2ʹ-azinobis-3-ethyl-benzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid and 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl as 679.66 and 4.16 mmol/(L·g) trolox equivalent, respectively, ferric reducing antioxidant power as 0.87 mmol/(L·g) Fe2+, total phenolic content as 29.90 mmol/(L·g) gallic acid and total flavonoid content as 12.16 mg/g catechin equivalent. Polyphenol compounds were identified mainly by standard polyphenols using the liquid chromatography mass spectrometry, with the highest contents of phytic acid, o-coumaric acid, naringin and kaempferol. The non-glutenous and wetland ecotypes of rice husk samples were the richest in antioxidant activities and polyphenol contents characterized by using principal component analysis. The glutenous rice husk contained higher antioxidant activities than the rest. Interestingly, quercetin is a significant phenolic compound that positively correlated with the overall antioxidant activities of rice husk.

Coral reefs serve as major networks of food and energy, where bacteria, microbial eukaryotes (fungi) and small eukaryotes play significant roles as primary producers that convert inorganic compounds to organic compounds, degraders of toxic substances, and recyclers. These functions sustain food and energy supplies. Advances in metagenomics and next-generation sequencing can provide knowledge of diversity without limitations imposed by media and other conditions associated with laboratory cultures. Scientists have researched bacterial diversity of coral sites; however, a database for fungi and small eukaryotes from Thailand's sites with abundant corals is lacking. The present study combined fungal ribosomal intergenic spacer analysis (F-RISA) and 18S rRNA gene sequencing to unveil the first culture-independent microbial and small eukaryotes from these sites at two times and across four species of coral (Porites lutea, Platygyra sinensis, Acropora humilis, and Acropora millepora), seawater and sediment. Results showed that the small eukaryotic communities on corals were distinct from communities in the surrounding seawater and sediment. The communities were relatively similar at the three sites and during the two periods of time.

All rights reserved.As global warming is worsening recently, coral bleaching is also happening more frequently because corals are sensitive to temperature change. Consequently, the need to study and monitor coral reefs is rapidly increasing in order to better understand the impact of environmental change on ocean ecology. There are two major approaches to monitoring coral reef. First, remote sensing, by using satellite imagery and/or aerial photography coral can be studied in large quantity in a very short period of time. The downside of this approach is that images obtained by satellite normally do not have enough spatial resolution and its images are not able to record very deep underwater objects. The second approach is using a diver to perform a detailed investigation of coral reef, which gives a lot more detail, but this approach is very time-consuming and expensive. Our aim is to use a small, commercially available camera as a tool to automatically monitor coral in real-time with the least possible human intervention. The main purpose of this research is to demonstrate that a consumer camera, with a little modification, can be used to detect coral bleaching. The modification was done so that the camera can record images in near-infrared range, which is important for coral detection. In this study, 5 coral species (Porites sp., Turbinaria sp., Acropora sp., Goniopora sp.and Pavona sp.), representing common local species, were induced to bleach by exposure to high water temperature for 24 hours. Images were taken periodically and 6 indices were constructed from those images. The indices which were IRR (Infrared-red), IRG (Infrared-Green), IRB (Infrared-Blue) and 3 variations of NDVI (Normal Difference Vegetation Index) were used to analyse the health of corals. The result shows that out of 6 indices being test the IRB index and NDVI (Blue) are the most promising pair for coral bleaching detection task.', 'Microbiomes of Healthy and Bleached Corals During a 2016 Thermal Bleaching Event in the Andaman Sea of Thailand Copyright  2022 Chavanich, Kusdianto, Kullapanich, Jandang, Wongsawaeng, Ouazzani, Viyakarn and Somboonna.As seawater temperature rises, repeated thermal bleaching events have negatively affected the reefs of the Andaman Sea for over decades. Studies on the coral-associated microbial diversity of prokaryotes and microbial eukaryotes (microbiome) in healthy and bleached corals are important to better understand the coral holobionts that involved augmented resistance to stresses, and this information remains limited in the Andaman Sea of Thailand. The present study thereby described the microbiomes of healthy (unbleached) and bleached colonies of four prevalent corals, Acropora humilis, Platygyra sp., Pocillopora damicornis, and Porites lutea, along with the surrounding seawater and sediments, that were collected during a 2016 thermal bleaching event, using 16S and 18S rRNA genes next-generation sequencing (NGS). Both prokaryotic and eukaryotic microbes showed isolated community profiles among sample types (corals, sediment, and seawater) [analysis of similarities (ANOSIM): p = 0.038 for prokaryotes, p < 0.001 for microbial eukaryotes] and among coral genera (ANOSIM: p < 0.001 for prokaryotes and microbial eukaryotes). In bleached state corals, we found differences in microbial compositions from the healthy state corals. Prevalent differences shared among bleached coral genera (shared in at least three coral genera) included a loss of reported coral-beneficial microbes, such as Pseudomonadales, Alteromonadales, and Symbiodinium; meanwhile an increase of putative coral-pathogenic Malassezia and Aspergillus. This difference could affect carbon and nitrogen availability for coral growth, reflective of a healthy or bleached state. Our findings in part supported previously microbial dysbiosis knowledge of thermal bleaching coral microbiomes around South East Asia marine geography, and together ongoing efforts are to support the understanding and management of microbial diversity to reduce the negative impacts to corals in massive thermal bleaching events.']"

All rights reserved.This study investigated L1 Chinese learners’ acquisition of the English “Noun + Relative Clause（N + RC）” based on Structural Priming (SP)(Bock,1986; Bock & Griffin, 2000) and Lexical Residual Activation (LRA)(Cleland, 2003). It was hypothesized that, based on SP, when L1 Chinese learners were primed by the English “N+ RC”, when the priming and the target structures shared different head nouns, they would produce more “N+ RC” than when they were primed by the English “Adj + Noun (Adj + N)”, and the priming effect was significant. Also, based on SP and LRA, when the priming and the target structures shared the same head noun, the increasing priming effect would be enhanced. The participants were 90 first year non-English major Chinese students attending Guizhou University of Finance and Economics, and 10 native English speakers. A picture description task was used to elicit data. The results confirmed the hypotheses. The study also found that there were different SP and LRA effects for L1 speakers and L2 speakers in that, while L2 speakers were significantly affected, L1 speakers were not. A long-term priming effect was found indirectly after the priming “Simple Sentence”. The study contributed to Second Language Acquisition in that SP and LRA would facilitate L1 Chinese learners’ acquisition of the English “Noun + Relative Clause”, although this structure is nonexistent in the learners’ L1. The study also gave pedagogical implications in that the application of SP and LRA would facilitate the acquisition of the L2 structures.', 'L2 production of English word stress by L1 Thai learners  2020 Language Institute, Thammasat University.

In total, 10 intermediate learners and 10 advanced learners participated in this study. The participants completed two production tasks: “Reading English Word Stress in Isolation” and “Reading English Word Stress in Sentences”. The results showed that the advanced learners had better English word stress production than the intermediate learners in both tasks. It was assumed that the errors made were caused by interlingual errors as the word stress assignment rules of the two languages were different. This led to negative transfer which interferes with L1 Thai learners’ acquisition of English word stress.

Red blood cell (RBC) transfusion is an essential treatment for severe forms of thalassemia. We performed a study to demonstrate RBC alloimmunization and other transfusion-related complications in patients with transfusion-dependent thalassemia (TDT). Study Design and Methods: A multi-center web-based registry of TDT was conducted in eight medical centers across Thailand. Thalassemia information, transfusion therapy, and transfusion-related complications were collected. Factors associated with each complication were demonstrated using the logistic regression analysis. Results: Of 1000 patients recruited for the study, 449 were males (44.9%). The mean age was 23.9 ± 15.4 years. The majority of patients, 738 (73.8%) had hemoglobin E/beta-thalassemia. In the study, 421 transfusion-related complications were reported from 357 patients (35.7%). Alloimmunization was the most common complication which was found in 156 patients (15.6%) with 284 positive antibody tests. The most frequent antibodies against RBC were anti-E (80/284, 28.2%) followed by anti-Mia (45/284, 15.8%) and anti-c (32/284, 11.3%). Age ≥3 years at initial blood transfusion, splenomegaly, higher frequencies, and volumes of transfusion were significant factors associated with alloimmunization. None of the patients had to terminate blood transfusion due to multiple alloantibodies. Other commonly seen complications were allergic reactions (130, 13.0%), autoimmune hemolytic anemia (70, 7.0%) and febrile non-hemolytic transfusion reaction (54, 5.4%). Conclusions: Transfusion-related complications, especially alloimmunization, were common among Thai patients with TDT. Extended RBC antigen-matching for the Rh system and Mia should be implemented to prevent the development of alloantibodies in multi-transfused patients.', 'Cell-Derived Microparticles in Blood Products from Blood Donors Deficient in Glucose-6-Phosphate Dehydrogenase  2021 American Society for Clinical Pathology,.

Methods: The current study analyzed whole blood and blood components prepared from 49 blood donors with G6PD deficiencies and 98 with G6PD-normal results. Packed red blood cells (PRBCs), platelet concentrate (PC), and plasma were prepared according to transfusion laboratory procedures. MP concentrations were determined using a flow cytometer. Results: Blood components prepared from donors with G6PD deficiency were characterized by higher red blood cell-derived MP (RMP) concentration in PRBCs (25,526 vs 18,738 particles/μL) but lower concentrations of platelet-derived MPs (PMPs; in whole blood and PC), leukocyte-derived MPs (LMP; in whole blood and plasma) and total MP (in PC), compared with those from donors with G6PD-normal test results. Conclusions: These results suggest that differences in G6PD status may account for variation in RMP levels during processing.', 'Thalassemia trait and G6PD deficiency in Thai blood donors  2019 Elsevier LtdBackground: Thalassemia trait and G6PD deficiency are asymptomatic and volunteers with these variants are eligible for blood donation.

Methods: Prospectively recruited blood donors were investigated for thalassemia and G6PD deficiency. Characteristic data, hematologic profiles, proportions of prepared blood components, donor return rate within 12 months and adverse reactions in patients receiving red cell transfusions were compared among thalassemia trait, G6PD deficiency, and normal donors. Results: In Thai blood donors, thalassemia trait prevalence was 21.1% and G6PD deficiency prevalence based on G6PD activity was 7.7%. Blood donors with thalassemia trait had significantly lower hemoglobin, MCV, and MCH than blood donors without thalassemia trait (Hb 13.55 ± 1.00 vs. 13.96 ± 1.25 g/dL, MCV 76.70 ± 6.69 vs. 87.01 ± 5.10 fL, and MCH 25.06 ± 2.17 vs. 28.67 ± 1.91 pg, all respectively and all p < 0.01). However, the hematologic profiles of blood donors with G6PD deficiency were not significantly different from the hematologic profiles of blood donors with normal G6PD activity. No significant difference was observed among thalassemia trait, G6PD deficiency, and normal donors relative to donor retention and blood component preparation. Conclusion: The high prevalence of thalassemia trait and G6PD deficiency in Thai blood donors observed in this study does not adversely affect donor retention and blood component preparation.']"

A meta-analysis was performed to examine the clinical and radiological effects of these two techniques. Methods: A search of relevant literature from several databases was conducted until November 2021. Perioperative outcomes, clinical and radiological results, and complications were analyzed. Results: Fifteen qualified studies were included. OLIF showed a shorter operative time and length of hospital stay and less blood loss than TLIF. Early postoperative Visual Analogue Scale for back pain were significantly lower in OLIF than in TLIF (P = 0.004). Noteworthy, although the preoperative Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) of the OLIF group was higher than that of the TLIF group (P = 0.04), the postoperative ODI was significantly lower (P < 0.05). Radiologically, the results showed that the disc and foraminal heights of OLIF were significantly higher than those of TLIF postoperatively. Moreover, OLIF can restore more segmental lordosis than TLIF in the early postoperative period. Furthermore, OLIF showed better fusion rates than TLIF (P = 0.02), with no difference in cage subsidence (13.4% vs. 16.6%). No significant differences in overall and approach-related complications between the two groups. Conclusion: The OLIF group showed an advantage in terms of operative time, hospitalization, intraoperative blood loss, early back pain relief, postoperative function recovery, disc and foraminal heights, early segmental lordosis, and fusion rate compared to TLIF.

Asian Spine Journal • pISSN 1976-1902 eISSN 1976-7846 • www.asianspinejournal.orgStudy Design: Retrospective cohort study. Purpose: To compare clinical and radiographic outcomes among minimally invasive transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion (MIS-TLIF), extreme lateral lumbar interbody fusion (XLIF), and oblique lateral lumbar interbody fusion (OLIF) techniques. Overview of Literature: To date, there are many reports comparing outcomes between MIS-TLIF and XLIF, MIS-TLIF and OLIF, or XLIF and OLIF procedures. However, there are no previous studies comparing clinical and radiographic outcomes among all these three techniques. Methods: Data from patients who underwent minimally invasive (MI) fusion surgery for lumbar degenerative diseases at L4–L5 level was analyzed. Thirty patients each from MIS-TLIF, XLIF, and OLIF groups were recruited for propensity score matching. Visual Analog Scale (VAS) of the back and legs and Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) were evaluated preoperatively and at 1, 3, and 6 months and 1 year postoperatively. Radiographic outcomes were also compared. The fusion rate was evaluated at 1 year after surgeries. Results: The clinical outcomes were significantly improved in all groups. The disk height was significantly restored in all groups postoperatively, which was significantly more improved in XLIF and OLIF than MIS-TLIF group (p <0.001). The axial canal area was significantly increased more in MIS-TLIF versus XLIF and OLIF (p <0.001). The correction of lumbar lordotic angle and segmental sagittal angle were similar among these techniques. OLIF and XLIF groups showed less blood loss and shorter hospital stays than MIS-TLIF group (p <0.001). There was no significant difference in fusion rate among all groups. Conclusions: MIS-TLIF, XLIF, and OLIF facilitated safe and effective MI procedures for treating lumbar degenerative diseases. XLIF and OLIF can achieve clinical outcomes equivalent to MIS-TLIF by indirect decompression. XLIF and OLIF showed less blood loss, shorter hospital stays, and better disk and foraminal height restorations. In single-level L4–5, the restoration of sagittal alignment was similar between these three techniques.', 'Endoscopic anterior to psoas lumbar interbody fusion: indications, techniques, and clinical outcomes  2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.Purpose: The retrospective study aimed to report the surgical technique and clinic-radiological outcomes of endoscopic anterior to psoas interbody lumbar fusion through the retroperitoneal approach with direct and indirect decompression. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed the results of clinical parameters of patients who underwent endoscopic anterior to psoas interbody lumbar fusion between June 2013 and June 2022. Clinical outcomes were evaluated by the visual analog scale (VAS) and Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) scores. The radiological outcomes were measured and statistically compared in disc height index (DHI), whole lumbar lordosis (WLL), pelvic Incidence (PI), pelvic tilt (PT), Segmental lordosis (SL), the sagittal vertical axis (SVA). Results: A total of 35 patients were selected for the procedure ranging in age from 51 to 84 years with 17.83 ± 8.85 months follow-up. The mean operation time in lateral position for one level was 162.96 ± 35.76 min (n = 24), and 207.73 ± 66.60 min for two-level fusion. The mean endoscopic time was 32.83 ± 17.71 min per level, with a total estimated blood loss of 230.57 ± 187.22 cc. The mean postoperative VAS back, leg pain score and ODI improved significantly compared to the preoperative values; Radiological data showed significant change in WLL, SL, DHI, PI, PT, and SS; however, there is no significant difference in SVA postoperatively. Subgroup analysis for the radiographic data showed 50 mm length cage has significantly improved for the DHI, SS and SVA compare to 40 mm length cage. The subgroup analysis results showed that hypertensive patients had significantly higher proportion in the incomplete fusion group compare to complete fusion group at one-year follow-up. Outcomes: The endoscopic anterior to psoas interbody lumbar fusion achieves satisfactory indirect and direct decompression. This convergent technique presents an effective choice for treating lumbar instability associated with disc herniations and foraminal stenosis, thus complementing the indications for oblique lumbar interbody fusion.']"

Deficit schizophrenia is characterized by an immune-inflammatory response combined with a deficit in natural IgM antibodies to oxidative-specific epitopes (OSEs), which are a first-line defense against bacterial infections. This study measured plasma IgA/IgM responses to 5 Gram-negative bacteria in association with IgM responses to malondialdehyde (MDA) and azelaic acid in 80 schizophrenia patients (40 with the deficit syndrome and 40 without) and in 38 healthy controls. Deficit schizophrenia was characterized by significantly increased IgA responses to Hafnei alvei, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Morganella morganii, and Klebsiella pneumoniae as compared with non-deficit schizophrenia. The presence of deficit schizophrenia was highly predicted by increased IgA responses to Pseudomonas putida and IgM responses to all five Gram-negative bacteria and lowered natural IgM to MDA and azelaic acid with a bootstrap area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.960 (2000 random curves). A large proportion of the variance (41.5%) in the negative subscale score of the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale was explained by the regression on IgA responses to K. pneumoniae and IgM responses to the five enterobacteria coupled with lowered IgM antibodies to azelaic acid. There were significant associations between IgA levels to Gram-negative bacteria and Mini-Mental State Examination, Boston naming test, Verbal Fluency, and Word List Memory test scores. These findings provide further evidence that deficit schizophrenia is a distinct phenotype of schizophrenia, which is characterized by an increased impact of Gram-negative commensal bacteria coupled with a deficit in natural IgM, pointing to aberrations in B1 cells. It is concluded that increased bacterial translocation and deficits in the compensatory immune-regulatory system (CIRS) may drive negative symptoms and neurocognitive impairments, which are hallmarks of deficit schizophrenia.', 'In Schizophrenia, Deficits in Natural IgM Isotype Antibodies Including those Directed to Malondialdehyde and Azelaic Acid Strongly Predict Negative Symptoms, Neurocognitive Impairments, and the Deficit Syndrome  2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.Schizophrenia is characterized by an interrelated activation of the immune-inflammatory response system (IRS) and the compensatory immune-regulatory system (CIRS), which downregulates the IRS. Deficit schizophrenia is characterized by a deficit in IgM-mediated autoimmune responses to tryptophan catabolites. The presence and correlates of IgM isotype antibodies to oxidative-specific epitopes (OSEs), nitroso (NO), and nitro (NO2) adducts in schizophrenia remain unknown. This study measured IgM antibodies to malondialdehyde (MDA), azelaic acid, phosphatidylinositol, oleic acid, NO-tryptophan, NO-albumin, NO-cysteinyl, and NO2-tyrosine in a sample of 80 schizophrenia patients, divided into those with and those without deficit schizophrenia, and 38 healthy controls. Deficit schizophrenia was characterized by significantly lower IgM antibody levels to all OSEs as compared with non-deficit schizophrenia and controls. Lowered IgM antibodies to MDA coupled with increased IgM levels to NO-cysteinyl and NO2-tyrosine strongly predict deficit schizophrenia versus non-deficit schizophrenia with an area under the ROC curve of 0.913. A large part of the variance (21.2–42.2%) in the negative symptoms of schizophrenia and excitation is explained by IgM antibody titers to MDA (inversely) and NO-cysteinyl and/or NO2-tyrosine (both positively). Lower IgM antibodies to MDA are significantly associated with impairments in episodic memory including direct and delayed recall. These findings further indicate that deficit schizophrenia is a distinct phenotype of schizophrenia, which is characterized by lower natural IgM antibody levels to OSEs and relative increments in nitrosylation and nitration of proteins. It is concluded that deficits in natural IgM attenuate CIRS functions and that this impairment may drive negative symptoms and impairments in episodic memory and thus deficit schizophrenia.', 'Deficit schizophrenia is a discrete diagnostic category defined by neuro-immune and neurocognitive features: results of supervised machine learning  2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.Deficit schizophrenia is characterized by neurocognitive impairments and changes in the patterning of IgA/IgM responses to plasma tryptophan catabolites (TRYCATs). In the current study, supervised pattern recognition methods, including logistic regression analysis (LRA), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Soft Independent Modeling of Class Analogy (SIMCA), were used to examine whether deficit schizophrenia is a discrete diagnostic class with respect to Consortium To Establish a Registry for Alzheimer’s disease (CERAD) and Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB) tests and IgA/IgM responses to noxious (NOX) and generally more protective (PRO) TRYCATs. We recruited patients with (n = 40) and without (n = 40) deficit schizophrenia and healthy volunteers (n = 40). The combined use of TRYCAT and CERAD features strongly segregates deficit from nondeficit schizophrenia and healthy controls. Three out of the top five most important features in LRA, SVM and SIMCA agreed, namely two different NOX/PRO TRYCAT ratios and false memory recall. SIMCA shows that deficit schizophrenia is significantly separated from nondeficit schizophrenia and controls with as top 6 features IgA responses to picolinic acid, IgM responses to 3-OH-kynurenine and kynurenic acid, and impairments in Word List Memory and Verbal Fluency Tests and Mini-Mental State Examination. Nevertheless, nondeficit schizophrenia was not significantly separated from controls. The results show that schizophrenia is not a unitary disease with mere continuous differences in severity of illness between apparent subtypes. Deficit schizophrenia is a qualitatively distinct class defined by neuroimmune (autoimmune responses to TRYCATs) and neurocognitive (episodic and semantic memory) features coupled or not with clinical (negative) symptoms.']"

In this study, we experimentally challenged Mozambique tilapia (Oreochromis mossambicus) with a virulent TiLV strain, VETKU-TV01, at both low (1 × 103 TCID50/mL) and high (1 × 105 TCID50/mL) concentration. After the challenge, the Mozambique tilapia showed pale skin with some hemorrhage and erosion, lethargy, abdominal swelling, congestion around the eye, and exophthalmos; there was a cumulative mortality rate at 48.89% and 77.78% in the groups that received the low and high concentration, respectively. Quantitative PCR and in situ hybridization confirmed the presence of TiLV in the internal organs of moribund fish. Notably, severe histopathological changes, including glycogen depletion, syncytial hepatic cells containing multiple nuclei and intracytoplasmic inclusion bodies, and infiltration of melanomacrophage into the spleen, were frequently found in the Mozambique tilapia challenged with high TiLV concentration. Comparatively, the infectivity and pathology of the TiLV infection in Mozambique tilapia and red hybrid tilapia (Oreochromis spp.) were found to be similar. Our results confirmed the susceptibility of Mozambique tilapia, which has recently been determined to be a vulnerable species, to TiLV infection, expanding knowledge that the virus can cause disease in this fish species.', 'Tilapia Lake Virus was not detected in non-tilapine species within tilapia polyculture systems of Bangladesh  2021 The Authors. Journal of Fish Diseases published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.Sixteen countries, including Bangladesh, have reported the presence of tilapia lake virus (TiLV), an emerging tilapia pathogen. Fish polyculture is a common farming practice in Bangladesh. Some unusual mortalities reported in species co-cultivated with TiLV-infected tilapia led us to investigate whether any of the co-cultivated species would also test positive for TiLV and whether they were susceptible to TiLV infection under controlled laboratory experiments. Using 183 samples obtained from 15 farms in six districts across Bangladesh, we determined that 20% of the farms tested positive for TiLV in tilapia, while 15 co-cultivated fish species and seven other invertebrates (e.g. insects and crustaceans) considered potential carriers all tested negative. Of the six representative fish species experimentally infected with TiLV, only Nile tilapia showed the typical clinical signs of the disease, with 70% mortality within 12 days. By contrast, four carp species and one catfish species challenged with TiLV showed no signs of TiLV infection. Challenged tilapia were confirmed as TiLV-positive by RT-qPCR, while challenged carp and walking catfish all tested negative. Overall, our field and laboratory findings indicate that species used in polycultures are not susceptible to TiLV. Although current evidence suggests that TiLV is likely host-specific to tilapia, targeted surveillance for TiLV in other fish species in polyculture systems should continue, in order to prepare for a possible future scenario where TiLV mutates and/or adapts to new host(s).', 'Immersion vaccination by a biomimetic-mucoadhesive nanovaccine induces humoral immune response of red tilapia (Oreochromis sp.) against flavobacterium columnare challenge  2021 by the authors.

However, the induction of a systemic immune response by the vaccine is yet to be investigated. Here, we examine if a specific hu-moral immune response is stimulated in tilapia by a biomimetic-mucoadhesive nanovaccine against Flavobacterium columnare using an indirect-enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), serum bactericidal activity (SBA) and the expression of immune-related genes within the head-kidney and spleen, together with assessing the relative percent survival of vaccinated fish after experimentally infecting them with F. columnare. The anti-IgM antibody titer of fish at 14 and 21 days post-vaccination was significantly higher in chitosan complex nanoemulsion (CS-NE) vaccinated fish compared to fish vaccinated with the formalin-killed vaccine or control fish, supporting the serum bactericidal activity results at these time points. The cumulative mortality of the unvaccinated control fish was 87% after challenging fish with the pathogen, while the cumulative mortality of the CS-NE vaccinated group was 24%, which was significantly lower than the formalin-killed vaccinated and control fish. There was a significant upregulation of IgM, IgT, TNF α, and IL1-β genes in the spleen and kidney of vaccinated fish. Significant upregulation of IgM and IgT genes was observed in the spleen of CS-NE vaccinated fish. The study confirmed the charged-chitosan-based mucoadhesive nanovaccine to be an effective platform for immersion vaccination of tilapia, with fish generating a humoral systemic immune response against columnaris disease in vaccinated fish.']"

These strains were placed in a monophyletic cluster consisting of Lactobacillus, Pediococcus, and Leuconostoc species and divided into seven groups based on phenotypic characteristics and 16S rRNA gene sequences. Eleven rod-shape strains of Lactobacillus were identified as L. brevis (Group I, 6 strains), L. pentosus (Group II, 2 strains), L. fermentum (Group III, 2 strains), and L. plantarum (Group IV, 1 strain). Two tetrad-forming strains of Pediococcus were identified as P. acidilactici (Group V, 1 strain) and P. pentosaceus (Group VI, 1 strain). In addition, three coccus chain bacteria were identified as Leuconostoc mesenteroides (Group VII, 3 strains). The produced GABA from the 16 strains ranged from 0.76±0.02 to 13.42±0.28 g/l.

The use of long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) is a proven and cost-effective intervention preventing malaria among pregnant women. The present study aimed to explore predictors of knowledge and use of LLINs among pregnant women in Pakistan. Methods: This was part of a quasi-experimental study of 200 pregnant women conducted in a rural district of Sindh province in Pakistan. Data were collected using Malaria Indicator Survey questionnaires developed by Roll Back Malaria Partnership to end Malaria Monitoring and Evaluation Reference Group. Pregnant women and mothers with newborns of six months of age were interviewed in their homes. Results: The age of the women was from 18 to 45, two thirds of the respondents (72.5%) were uneducated and married (77%). Majority (92%) of the women had received antenatal care during pregnancy, and 29.5% women had received counseling on malaria during their antenatal care visits. Multiple linear regression showed that the type of latrine was the most significant (β = 0.285, p < 0.001) determinant of knowledge about malaria among pregnant women followed by the death of a newborn (β = 0.271, p < 0.001). The use of mobile phone was the most significant (β = 0.247, p < 0.001) predictor of usage of LLINs among pregnant women followed by the death of a newborn (β = 0.232, p < 0.05). Conclusions: Maternal education, type of latrine, use of mobile phone, malaria during previous pregnancy and newborn death were strong predictors of knowledge and use of LLINs in pregnant women in Pakistan. There is a need to scale-up programmes that aim to create awareness regarding malaria among pregnant women. Mobile phone technology can be used to implement awareness programmes focusing on malaria prevention among women.', 'Barriers to prompt and effective malaria treatment among malaria infected patients in Palaw township, Tanintharyi region, Myanmar  2018 Authors.

This qualitative article draws on the critical analysis of theories in authoritarianism and electoral integrity to shed light on the concept of competitive authoritarianism. The article, utilizing empirical data and historical narratives, illustrates Thailand’s legal and political environment governing this election. The electoral results and post-election political party landscape reveal unintended consequences in manipulating political institutions. Although the newly introduced electoral system and institutional manipulations allowed the military co-opted Palang Pracharat party to select the prime minister even without controlling a majority in the House of Representatives, as projected, the establishment was inadvertently left with two robust opposition parties, namely the old Pheu Thai and the new-born Future Forward parties. The former represents the strongest political machine in Thailand, which has won five consecutive elections, while the latter symbolizes a new divide in Thai politics, armed with the power of social media, and poses a bigger threat to the military establishment. Remarkably, the electoral result not only pointed to a continued polarization, dominated by the cleavages of ultraconservative versus progressive and an urban-rural, rich-poor cleavage, but also a new division between older and younger generations. This article maintains that although Thailand’s civil-military government might be deposed in the future due to several challenges facing them, the undemocratic political structure of military electoral co-optation polity remains ingrained on account of the way that the 2017 Constitution was crafted.', 'China’s rise in mainland Asean: Regional evidence and local responses  2021 by World Scientific Publishing Co. Pte. Ltd.In today’s rapid rise and expansion of China’s influence all around the world and in ASEAN during the past two decades, there has been an increasing awareness of various countries and regions adjusting themselves to the new trends, both in terms of opportunities and risks alike. This has become necessary due to the rapid changes in many aspects - political landscapes, economic issues, as well as social and cultural considerations. This book, China’s Rise in Mainland ASEAN: Regional Evidence and Local Responses, provides timely insights on some of the latest issues pertaining to ASEAN and China, rapidly shifting interactions and upcoming geostrategic challenges. ASEAN can be said to be undergoing a new era, with China becoming more intertwined and involved with the ASEAN region than ever before. The complexity of the regional dynamics means that this phenomenon cannot be captured with a single narrative or discipline of study. In addressing the matters at hand, this book sets out to examine and provide deeper understandings on the regional implications, and local responses from ASEAN countries, and from the perspective of the region as a whole. The underlying rationale is that adequate understanding on the matters involved in this new ASEAN-China era will help to encourage better and mutually beneficial relationships between both sides. The analysis of this book will be categorized into four main themes - (1) “The Big Picture”, concerning China’s policies, strategies, and diplomatic stances, (2) “Implications and Responses”, dealing with how ASEAN members react and respond to China’s actions and regional influence, (3) “Perspectives on Trade, Investment and External Debt”, which handles the economic facets of the ASEAN-China interactions, and (4) “Connectivity in Focus”, addressing various emerging and existing dimensions of connectivity expansion between ASEAN and China, both physical and virtual.', 'Celebrating the third decade and beyond: New challenges to ASEAN-India economic partnership  2018 ASEAN-India Centre (AIC), Research and Information System for Developing Countries (RIS); ASEAN Studies Centre (ASC), Chulalongkorn University and KW Publishers Pvt Ltd.The ASEAN-India economic integration has made substantial progress in recent years. India’s engagements with Southeast and East Asia have received new momentum under the Act East Policy (AEP). In 2017, ASEAN and India will be celebrating 25 years of their dialogue relations. The relationship is set to deepen in coming days as ASEAN and India step up their collaboration across a range of economic and strategic issues, including trade and connectivity, culture, people-to-people links, trans-national terrorism, and maritime security. However, both of them have been facing several challenges which call for concerted efforts by ASEAN and India. With ASEAN and India working towards establishing a Comprehensive Free Trade Area through Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) agreement, their cooperation will be key in promoting economic stability, competitiveness, growth and integration in the region. This book is a timely initiative to review the past and suggest the ways to further strengthen the economic partnership. It primarily deals with the economic integration issues between ASEAN and India, and assesses policy priorities, effectiveness, implementation imperatives and challenges. Each chapter in this book tries to capture essential features of the crosscutting issues and attempts to draw some policy implications. It will be a valuable reference for policymakers, academics and practitioners.']"

Design/methodology/approach: A multi-sector system dynamics model was developed to capture the dynamic interrelationship between dental caries status changes and oral health behavior – including self-care, dental care utilization and sugar consumption. Data used to populate the model was obtained from the Thai national oral health survey in 2000, 2006, 2012 and Thailand Official Statistics Registration. Three policy scenarios were experimented in the model: health promotion policy, dental personnel policy and affordable dental care service policy. Findings: Dental caries experiences among Thai adults and elderly were projected to increase from now to 2040, as the elderly population increases. Among all policies experimented herein, the combined policies of health promotion, increased affordability and capacity of dental health service were found to produce the highest improvement in dental caries status with 3.7 percent reduction of population with high decayed, missing and filled teeth (DMFT) and 5.2 percent increase in population with very low DMFT. Originality/value: This study is the first comprehensive simulation model that attempts to explore the dynamic interrelationship among dental caries experiences and behavioral factors that impact on oral health outcomes.

Design/methodology/approach: This study is a cross-sectional analytical study using secondary data from the 7th Thailand National Oral Health Survey (2012). Age group 35–44 years old samples were used to represent the working age population. Oral health outcome was determined by untreated dental caries. SES was indicated by income, education and occupational groups. Demographic background, oral health-related behavior and access to dental service were adjusted for analysis. Binary logistic regression analysis was performed to determine the relationship between independent variables and oral health outcome. Findings: People with lower education showed a higher odds ratio for having untreated dental caries before and after controlling for related variables. Those living in the north and northeast, using additional cleaning tools and going to the public provider for dental service also showed better oral health. Research limitations/implications: The limitation of this study is that the cross-sectional study cannot indicate casual relationships. The national oral health survey was not designed to find relationships between factors. The access to data and measurement of SES was limited. The policy maker should emphasize on people with lower education which have a higher risk for dental caries to improve oral health in disadvantaged groups. Future research should include all related factors in the study including diet and knowledge about oral health. Moreover, oral health outcome is a long-term effect which accumulated through a lifetime. The social class might change over time and so do behaviors.

Preschool children (4-to 5-year-old children) were recruited. The participants’ parents completed a questionnaire regarding their children’s demographic and socio-economic backgrounds and their oral health-related behaviors. Dental caries status and oral hygiene were recorded using the decayed, missing, and filled teeth index (dmft) and visible plaque index (VPI), respectively. In total, 308 children completed the oral examination (93.9% response rate). The mean age of the children was 5.1 ± 0.5 years old. Among them, 249 children (80.8%) had dental caries (dmft > 0) and their mean dmft score (SD) was 8.2 (4.7). The children’s age, VPI, primary caregiver, age of starting tooth brushing, assisted tooth brushing, and mother’s education level were significantly associated with dental caries (X2 test, p < 0.05). The multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that older children with a higher VPI score and whose mothers had lower education had a significantly higher risk of having dental caries (p < 0.05). Caries prevalence was high among the evaluated Thai preschool children. The child’s age, visible dental plaque, and mother’s educational level are significant risk factors for dental caries.']"

European Journal of Neurology published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd on behalf of European Academy of Neurology.Background: A large proportion of older adults assessed for cognitive impairment likely have hearing loss, potentially affecting accuracy of cognitive performance estimations. This study aimed to develop a hearing-impaired version of the Addenbrooke's Cognitive Examination-III (HI-ACE-III) and to assess whether the HI-ACE-III can accurately distinguish people with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia from cognitively intact controls. Methods: The HI-ACE-III was developed by converting verbal instructions into a visual, timed PowerPoint presentation. Seventy-four participants over the age of 60 years were classified into three groups: 29 had MCI, 15 had mild to moderate dementia and 30 were cognitively intact controls. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were graphed to test screening accuracy. Concurrent validity was examined through correlations between HI-ACE-III domain scores and relevant, visually presented standardized neuropsychological measures. Results: ROC analysis for dementia revealed an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.99, achieving excellent sensitivity (100%) and good specificity (93.3%) at an optimum cut-off of <87. The AUC for MCI was 0.86, achieving reasonable sensitivity (75.9%) and good specificity (86.7%) at an optimum cut-off of <92. HI-ACE-III subtests shared anticipated and statistically significant correlations with established measures of cognitive functioning. Internal consistency of the HI-ACE-III was excellent as verified with Cronbach's alpha (α = 0.904). Conclusions: Preliminarily, the HI-ACE-III showed good reliability, validity and screening utility for MCI and dementia in older adults in a hearing-impairment context.

Objectives: This study aimed to determine the reliability and validity of the following: (a) Thai translation of the MoCA (MoCA-Thai) and (b) delineate the key features of aMCI based on the MoCA subdomains. Methods: This study included 60 HCs, 61 aMCI patients, and 60 AD patients. The MoCA-Thai shows adequate psychometric properties including internal consistency, concurrent validity, test-retest validity, and inter-rater reliability. Results: The MoCA-Thai may be employed as a diagnostic criterion to make the diagnosis of aMCI, whereby aMCI patients are discriminated from HC with an area under the receiver-operating characteristic (AUC-ROC) curve of 0.813 and from AD patients with an AUC-ROC curve of 0.938. The best cutoff scores of the MoCA-Thai to discriminate aMCI from HC is ≤24 and from AD > 16. Neural network analysis showed that (a) aberrations in recall was the most important feature of aMCI versus HC with impairments in language and orientation being the second and third most important features and (b) aberrations in visuospatial skills and executive functions were the most important features of AD versus aMCI and that impairments in recall, language, and orientation but not attention, concentration, and working memory, further discriminated AD from aMCI.

Methods: A cross–sectional descriptive study obtained the baseline data from the project named the Thailand Parental Supply and Use of Alcohol, Cigarettes & Drugs Longitudinal Study Cohort in Secondary School Students in 2018. The sample size was 1187 students who have ever sipped or drank alcohol in the past 12 months. Pearson’s Chi square, binary logistic regression, and ordinal logistic regression are applied in the analysis. Results: A single source of parental supply is not significantly associated with any alcohol-related harm and the severity of alcohol use disorder, while parental supply with peers and siblings supply of alcohol plays an important role in both outcomes. The increasing number of sources of alcohol supply increases the risk of alcohol–related harm and the severity of alcohol use disorder. Other risk factors found in both associations included binge drinking, alcohol flushing, low household economic status, distance from the student’s family, and poor academic performance.

At baseline, a survey with validated screening tools was used to classify respondents as having no, or one or more of the following: 1) depression, 2) anxiety, and 3) regular alcohol use. Multivariable adjusted regression analyses were used to examine whether baseline (2018) self-report conditions were associated with quit attempts; quit success; and vaping status by follow-up (2020). Results showed that respondents who reported depressive symptoms were more likely than those without to have made a quit attempt (aOR = 1.32, 95% CI:1.03–1.70, p = 0.03), but were less likely to have quit (aOR = 0.55, 95% CI:0.34–0.89, p = 0.01). There were no differences in quit attempts or quit success between those with and without self-reported anxiety diagnoses or regular alcohol use. Among successful quitters, respondents with baseline depressive symptoms and self-reported anxiety diagnoses were more likely than those without to report vaping at follow-up (aOR = 2.58, 95% CI:1.16–5.74, p = 0.02, and aOR = 3.35 95% CI:1.14–9.87, p = 0.03). In summary, it appears that smokers with depression are motivated to quit smoking but were less likely to manage to stay quit, and more likely to be vaping if successfully quit. As smoking rates are higher among people with mental health conditions, it is crucial for healthcare professionals to identify these vulnerable groups and offer tailored smoking cessation support and continued support during their quit attempt.', 'Smoking and Drinking Behaviors among Older Adults: A Comparative Analysis of Three Southeast Asian Countries  2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.Studies on the two major health-risk behaviors of smoking tobacco and drinking alcohol among older populations, particularly in Southeast Asia, are limited. This paper provides comparative analyses of the prevalences and correlates of smoking tobacco and drinking alcohol among older people in Myanmar, Vietnam, and Thailand, using data from the latest available national aging surveys in the three countries. The analyses were conducted within a multivariate framework. Gender-specific results show that smoking tobacco and drinking alcohol are more common among older men than women in all three countries. However, the prevalence of smoking and drinking among men declines at older ages. The multivariate analyses reveal that a higher level of education has a significant negative association with smoking and drinking in all three settings, but the magnitude and the direction of associations vary considerably between countries and genders. Area of residence is correlated with smoking among men in all three countries, whereas co-residential arrangements with spouse, children, or both significantly reduce alcohol consumption among men in Myanmar and among men and women in Thailand. In all three settings a significant complementary relationship between smoking and drinking is observed. From a policy perspective this implies that a successful reduction in smoking could be achieved through anti-drinking campaigns and vice versa.']"

Based on rainfall gauge data over 36 years (1981– 2016), a frequency analysis was performed for this basin to understand and evaluate its overall flood risk; daily rainfall measurements of 119 rain gauge stations within the basin were considered. Four common probability distributions, i.e., Log-Normal (LOG), Gumbel type-I (GUM), Pearson type-III (PE3), and Log-Pearson type-III (LP3) distributions, were used to calculate the return period of rainfall at each station and at the basin-scale level. Results of each distribution were compared with the graphical Gringorten method to analyze their performance; GUM was found to be the best-fitted distribution among the four. Thereafter, design hyetographs were developed by integrating the return period of rainfall based on three adopted methods at basin and subbasin scales; each method had its pros and cons for hydrological applications. Finally, utilizing a Rainfall-Runoff-Inundation (RRI) model, we estimated the possible flood inundation extent and depth, which was outlined over the Chao Phraya River Basin using the design hyetographs with different return periods.

However, the development of design hyetographs for the evaluation of flood inundation under extreme rainfall is challenging. We evaluated the flood inundation depth and extent in the Chao Phraya River Basin, one of the largest river basins in Asia, which is often vulnerable to water-related disasters. Rainfall data from 119 stations within the basin were collected for a frequency analysis. After processing the 36-year daily rainfall data, a frequency analysis of the maximum monthly rainfall was performed at each station using the Gumbel distribution. The maximum monthly rainfall for various return periods varied substantially among stations. For an inundation analysis over the entire river basin, we produced design hyetographs by integrating extreme rainfall values for each month according to the return period. These design hyetographs were included in a rainfall-runoffinundation model to simulate the maximum inundation depth profile over the basin for different return periods. The Maximum inundation depths were 8.3, 9.0, 9.7, and 10.5 m for return periods of 50, 100, 200, and 500 years, respectively, over the Chao Phraya River Basin. Similarly, approximately 16.3%, 17.1%, 17.8%, and 18.6% of the basin area was inundated (depth > 0.5 m) over the return periods, respectively.

All rights reserved.This research studies the land use dynamics and its effects on rainfall-runoff and runoff-sediment relationships in Yom river basin of Thailand. The study compares land use land coverage change (LULCC), rainfall-runoff pattern, and sediment load in the main river course from 1980s to 1990s and to 2014. A land use map updated from different periods (Land Development Department, Thailand) in combination with digital elevation model (DEM) and satellite imageries have been carried out as inputs for land use change coverage analysis. Double mass curve with trend curve analysis is employed to evaluate the effects of LULCC on rainfall-runoff and runoff-sediment yield relationships. The results indicate that from 1990 to 2014, many forests in Yom river basin have been significantly transformed into farmland and irrigation area, especially in high-slope locations relatively further away from the main river course. This change of land use pattern has consecutively altered the rainfall-runoff and runoff-sediment relationships, and lead to more pronounced slope of trend curve (STC) of annual rainfall-runoff and runoff-sediment mass curves in 1990s compared to 2000s, implying that more soil and water loss yield in 2000s. One can logically suggest that the runoff-sediment load obtained during 1990s is higher than 2000s with similar rainfall/runoff, which can further be explained by the historic landuse dynamics. With the new water allocation scheme for flood risk reduction in the lower Chaophraya river basin, agricultural practices have spatio-temporally changed and parts of Yom river basin have been used for flood retention areas, significant alteration in rainfall-runoff and runoff-sediment patterns has been observed (i.e., in Bangrakam and Kongkrailart Districts). Continuous reduction of forest fraction results in soil loss, landslide, river bank erosion, and flood occurrence results in a more degrading river water quality and potential decrease in river capacity for flood protection, all involved stakeholder such as local authorities, communities, farmers, and policy makers should pay attention to apply appropriate land use and watershed management and flood risk reduction practices.']"

This study aimed to explore the distribution and characteristics of Escherichia coli isolates harboring mcr genes from slaughtered pigs in Thailand from 2014 to 2015. A total of 779 E. coli isolates were assessed, of which 61 (7.8%) were found to carry mcr genes, including mcr-1, mcr-3, mcr-6, mcr-7, mcr-8, and mcr-9, together with co-occurrences of mcr-1+mcr-3, mcr-1+mcr-9, and mcr-3+mcr-6+mcr-7. In these mcr-harboring E. coli isolates, mcr-1 (40.9%) and mcr-9 (32.8%) were predominant. Colistin resistance was mainly mediated by the mcr-1 gene, whereas intermediate resistance was noted in isolates that harbored mcr-9, mcr-6, mcr-7, and mcr-8 genes. Most E. coli isolates harboring mcr genes were susceptible to third-generation cephalosporins and all of these isolates were susceptible to carbapenems. Clermont phylotyping demonstrated that mcr-harboring isolates mainly belonged to phylogroup A (44.3%), followed by phylogroups B1 (34.4%), D (14.8%), and B2 (6.6%). Multilocus sequence typing revealed that 25 sequence types (STs) were assigned to 45 mcr-harboring E. coli isolates, whereas the remaining 16 isolates were novel STs. The mcr-1 and mcr-9 genes were mostly predominant in ST101 and ST8900, respectively. This study provides a comprehensive insight into the prevalence and diversity of mcr-harboring E. coli isolates obtained from slaughtered pigs across Thailand. Strengthening of surveillance systems by the government for controlling and preventing mcr dissemination from animals to humans or vice versa is urgently needed. No clinical trial registration number.', 'Colistin resistance and plasmid-mediated mcr genes in Escherichia coli and Salmonella isolated from pigs, pig carcass and pork in Thailand, Lao PDR and Cambodia border provinces  2021 The Korean Society of Veterinary ScienceBackground: Colistin and carbapenem-resistant bacteria have emerged and become a serious public health concern, but their epidemiological data is still limited. Objectives: This study examined colistin and carbapenem resistance in Escherichia coli and Salmonella from pigs, pig carcasses, and pork in Thailand, Lao PDR, and Cambodia border provinces. Methods: The phenotypic and genotypic resistance to colistin and meropenem was determined in E. coli and Salmonella obtained from pigs, pig carcasses, and pork (n = 1,619). A conjugative experiment was performed in all isolates carrying the mcr gene (s) (n = 68). The plasmid replicon type was determined in the isolates carrying a conjugative plasmid with mcr by PCR-based replicon typing (n = 7). The genetic relatedness of mcr-positive Salmonella (n = 11) was investigated by multi-locus sequence typing. Results: Colistin resistance was more common in E. coli (8%) than Salmonella (1%). The highest resistance rate was found in E. coli (17.8%) and Salmonella (1.7%) from Cambodia. Colistin-resistance genes, mcr-1, mcr-3, and mcr-5, were identified, of which mcr-1 and mcr-3 were predominant in E. coli (5.8%) and Salmonella (1.7%), respectively. The mcr-5 gene was observed in E. coli from pork in Cambodia. Two colistin-susceptible pig isolates from Thailand carried both mcr-1 and mcr-3. Seven E. coli and Salmonella isolates contained mcr-1 or mcr-3 associated with the IncF and IncI plasmids. The mcr-positive Salmonella from Thailand and Cambodia were categorized into two clusters with 94%–97% similarity. None of these clusters was meropenem resistant. Conclusions: Colistin-resistant E. coli and Salmonella were distributed in pigs, pig carcasses, and pork in the border areas. Undivided-One Health collaboration is needed to address the issue.', 'Plasmid-mediated colistin resistance and ESBL production in Escherichia coli from clinically healthy and sick pigs  2022, The Author(s).This study aimed to determine the percentage of colistin resistant and ESBL-producing Escherichia coli from clinically sick and healthy pigs and understand the molecular mechanisms underlying colistin resistance and ESBL production. A total of 454 E. coli isolates from healthy pigs (n = 354; piglets, n = 83; fattening pigs, n = 142 and sows, n = 100) and sick pigs (n = 100) were examined for antimicrobial susceptibility, chromosomal and plasmid-mediated colistin resistance mechanisms and ESBL genes. The healthy (41%) and sick pig (73%) isolates were commonly resistant to colistin. Three mcr genes including mcr-1 (10.4%), mcr-2 (1.1%) and mcr-3 (45%) were detected, of which mcr-3 was most frequently detected in the healthy (33%) and sick pig (57%) isolates. Coexistence of mcr-1/mcr-3 and mcr-2/mcr-3 was observed in piglets (23%), fattening pig (3.5%) and sick pig (13%) isolates. Three amino acid substitutions including E106A and G144S in PmrA and V161G in PmrB were observed only in colistin-resistant isolates carrying mcr-3. The percentage of ESBL-producing E. coli was significantly higher in the sick pigs (44%) than the healthy pigs (19.2%) (P = 0.00). The blaCTX-M group was most prevalent (98.5%), of which blaCTX-M-14 (54.5%) and blaCTX-M-55 (42.9%) were predominant. The blaTEM-1 (68.8%) and blaCMY-2 (6.3%) genes were identified in ESBL-producers. All ESBL producers were multidrug resistant and the majority from piglets (97%), fattening pigs (77.3%) and sick pigs (82%) carried mcr gene (s). ESBL producers from piglets (n = 5) and sick pig (n = 1) simultaneously transferred blaTEM-1 (or blaCTX-M-55) and mcr-3 to Salmonella. In conclusion, pigs are important reservoirs of colistin-resistant E. coli that also produced ESBLs, highlighting the need for prudent and effective use of antimicrobials in pigs and other food-producing animals.']"

In this study, folic acid (FA)-grafted chitosan-alginate nanocapsules (CS-Alg-NCs) loaded with turmeric oil (TO) were developed for breast cancer targeting. CS was successfully conjugated with FA via an amide bond with a degree of substitution at 12.86%. The TO-loaded FA-grafted CS-Alg-NCs (TO-FA-CS-Alg-NCs) optimized by Box-Behnken design using response surface methodology had satisfactory characteristics with homogenous particle size (189 nm) and sufficient encapsulation efficiency and loading capacity (35.9% and 1.82%, respectively). In vitro release study of the optimized TO-FA-CS-Alg-NCs showed a sustained TO release following the Korsmeyer-Peppas model with a Fickian diffusion mechanism at pH 5.5 and 7.4. The TO-FA-CS-Alg-NCs showed lower IC50 than ungrafted TO-CS-Alg-NCs and unencapsulated TO against MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 breast cancer cells, suggesting that FA-CS-Alg-NCs can improve anticancer activity of TO through its active targeting to the high FRs expressing breast cancers.', 'Synergistic effects of photo-irradiation and curcumin-chitosan/alginate nanoparticles on tumor necrosis factor-alpha-induced psoriasis-like proliferation of keratinocytes  2019 by the authors.Psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory skin disease characterized by hyperproliferation of the epidermal cells and is clinically presented as thick, bright red to pink plaques with a silvery scale. Photodynamic therapy (PDT) using visible light has become of increasing interest in the treatment of inflammatory skin diseases. In this study, we demonstrate that a combination of curcumin-loaded chitosan/alginate nanoparticles (Cur-CS/Alg NPs) and blue light emitting diodes (LED) light irradiation effectively suppressed the hyperproliferation of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α)-induced cultured human kerlatinocyte (HaCaT) cells. The Cur-CS/Alg NPs were fabricated by emulsification of curcumin in aqueous sodium alginate solution and ionotropic gelation with calcium chloride and chitosan using an optimized formulation derived from a Box-Behnken design. The fabricated Cur-CS/Alg NPs were characterized for their particle size, zeta potential, encapsulation efficiency, and loading capacity. The surrogate 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay, to measure the relative number of viable cells, showed that the CS/Alg NPs were nontoxic to normal HaCaT cells, while 0.05 µg/mL and 0.1 µg/mL of free curcumin and Cur-CS/Alg NPs inhibited the hyperproliferation of HaCaT cells induced by TNF-α. However, the Cur-CS/Alg NPs demonstrated a stronger effect than the free curcumin, especially when combined with blue light irradiation (10 J/cm2) from an LED-based illumination device. Therefore, the Cur-CS/Alg NPs with blue LED light could be potentially developed into an effective PDT system for the treatment of psoriasis.', 'Chitosan/alginate nanoparticles as a promising approach for oral delivery of curcumin diglutaric acid for cancer treatment  2018Curcumin diglutaric acid (CG) is a prodrug of curcumin that shows better solubility and antinociceptive activity compared to curcumin. To improve its properties further, CG was encapsulated into polysaccharide-based nanoparticles in this study. A chitosan/alginate nanoparticulate system was chosen for encapsulation of CG due to its biocompatibility, biodegradability, non-toxicity, mucoadhisiveness and good film formation. CG-loaded chitosan/alginate nanoparticles were prepared by o/w emulsification and ionotropic gelification, with the conditions optimized using response surface methodology. A chitosan/alginate mass ratio of 0.04:1, CG concentration of 3 mg/mL and Pluronic®F127 concentration of 0.50% (w/v) were determined to be optimal for the nanoparticle preparation. FTIR and XRD confirmed encapsulation of CG into the chitosan/alginate nanoparticles. The CG-loaded chitosan/alginate nanoparticles showed better stability under UV radiation and in a simulated gastrointestinal environment, compared to a CG dispersion in water. The nanoparticles showed slow cumulative release of CG in simulated gastrointestinal fluids without enzymes and in body fluid. A Weibull model of the best fit for all conditions suggested that the release pattern of CG from CG-loaded chitosan/alginate nanoparticles was mainly controlled by Fickian diffusion and erosion of polymer materials. Finally, CG-loaded chitosan/alginate nanoparticles showed higher in vitro cellular uptake in human epithelial colorectal adenocarcinoma (Caco-2 cells) and better anticancer activity against Caco-2, human hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2) and human breast cancer (MDA-MB-231) cells. Therefore, the CG-loaded chitosan/alginate nanoparticles are a promising approach for oral administration of CG for cancer treatment.']"

All rights reserved.In recent decades, there has been an attempt to introduce the concept of ""assessment for learning"" into English language classrooms based on a belief that assessment can be utilized to assist learners in the learning process, not just for teachers to make judgments and decisions. In so doing, the learning-oriented assessment frameworks proposed by a number of scholars have been introduced to integrate the use of both formative and summative assessments into language pedagogy to enhance language skills simultaneously with developing learners\' assessment expertise, hence enabling them to better identify their own strengths and weaknesses, which, in turn, helps promote their learning outcomes. The primary aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of the implementation of a learning-oriented reading assessment model on Thai undergraduate students\' reading ability. Students\' involvement in several types of assessment embedded in reading instructional procedures was the highlight of the model implementation. The participants were 25 first-year undergraduate students enrolled in a foundation English course at a public university. A mixed-method research design was employed to gather both quantitative and qualitative data using the in-house English proficiency tests, the end-of-unit tests, and the learners\' journal.

Background: Improving quality nursing care is a first consideration in nursing management globally. A better understanding of factors influencing quality nursing care can help hospital administrators implement effective programmes to improve quality of services.

The Ni2P phase was clearly present in the Ni2P/C catalyst with a Ni:P ratio of 1.5 and a 5.37 mmol Ni loading level. The catalysts were then evaluated for the hydrodeoxygenation of the pyrolysis vapor derived from the integrated pyrolysis and upgrading of Napier grass, with two fixed bed reactors in series, at different upgrading temperatures and space velocities. The reaction could be carried out at atmospheric pressure. The maximum bio-oil yield was obtained at an upgrading temperature of 340 °C, while the major components of the bio-oil were phenolic compounds (>50%). An upgrading temperature of 360 °C did not only present dehydration but aromatization was also predominant. Moreover, the phenolic compounds decreased with increasing space velocity. The oxygen content in the pyrolysis vapor was catalytically removed via the dehydration pathway, which significantly decreased the oxygen/carbon ratio from 0.24 to 0.17.

The use of fly ash offers several benefits such as reducing the fly ash disposal cost, solving environmental problems, and significantly increasing high valued products. Catalytic fast pyrolysis of kraft lignin using ZSM-5/ SBA-15 catalyst prepared from fly ash was studied using a pyrolysis-GC/MS system. The influence of temperature (400–600°C) during thermal pyrolysis, the FA-ZSM-5 and FA-SBA-15 ratios (1:0, 2:1, 1:1, 1:2, 0:1), and lignin-to-catalyst ratios (1:5 and 1:10) on the hydrocarbon selectivity was investigated. Non-catalytic pyrolysis volatiles consisted of a high proportion of guaiacol compounds (G-type, 66.7%) and p-hydroxyl phenols (H-type, 18.0%). The presence of zeolite catalysts contributed to enhance both aliphatic and aromatic production, while a proportion of guaiacyl decreased significantly. The highest selectivity of aliphatic and aromatic HCs was achieved at feed to catalyst ratios of 1:10. Coupling HZSM-5 and Al-SBA-15 catalysts were more reactive in converting the alkoxy-phenol (G-type) and p-hydroxyphenyl compounds (P-type) toward both aliphatic HCs and monocyclic-aromatic HCs (MAHs), particularly benzene, toluene and xylene (BTX). Among all catalysts, FA-ZSM-5/ FA-SBA-15 ratio of 1:2 showed the optimum dual catalyst ratio to enhance the highest yield of aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons of 15.1 and 21.4 % with the acceptable yield of phenolic compounds (34%).

In this paper, high-density polyethylene (HDPE) and brown salwood were tested in a custom-built laboratory-scale fixed-bed reactor to investigate the co-pyrolysis reaction at temperatures ranging from 500 to 650 °C, nitrogen flow rates ranging from 40 to 160 mL min−1, and HDPE-to-biomass ratios ranging from 0.1 to 0.9. The results revealed that the temperature mostly influenced the pyrolysis products, whereas increasing the temperature to 600 °C promoted pyrolysis oil production, reaching a yield of 35.10 ± 1.20 wt%. Further increasing the reaction temperature to 650 °C decreased the yield to 34.57 ± 0.49 wt% because secondary cracking reactions produce a noncondensable gas rich in hydrocarbons. Physicochemical analysis of the pyrolyzed organic phase revealed a gross calorific heating value of up to approximately 38.19 MJ kg−1. Additionally, co-pyrolysis of HDPE improved the production of furans, and acid derivatives were obtained in the aqueous fraction via the thermal conversion of hemicellulose and lignin; conversely, the obtained char exhibited a notably low surface area and few superficial micropores and was used to further develop activated carbon for use as a catalyst in the catalytic pyrolysis of waste materials.']"

The research also does not cover industrial complex areas using integrated perspectives. Most studies on major business continuity disasters focus on event impacts and the short-term responses and recovery process of enterprises. Some evaluate the underlying causes of vulnerability, but few follow up to evaluate the consequences of the business continuity process because of restrictions on information disclosure regarding these activities. The objective of this study is to improve understanding of the influence that business continuity narratives have had on how decisions and actions are undertaken to continue business after a flood disaster, and what long-term influence this has had, in turn, on the industrial complex area from integrated perspectives, especially applying the lessons learned. This research drew on insights from in-depth studies of Japanese enterprises to maximize the findings based on abundant field data: (1) disaster responses in the flood risk situation; (2) the challenges faced by enterprises in the area before, during and following the 2011 floods; and (3) lessons that led to new consideration for the flood risk in the areas following the 2011 flood. This study identified alternative narratives on the purpose and means of business continuity with implications for flood risk by constructing scenarios for practical use. The findings of this study provide new insights and will improve the performance of business continuity management, both existing and planned, and, ultimately, support more climate-resilient development in this area.', 'Climatic and Hydrological Factors Affecting the Assessment of Flood Hazards and Resilience Using Modified UNDRR Indicators: Ayutthaya, Thailand  2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.This research aims to investigate the effect of climatic and hydrological factors on flood hazards and assess flood resilience in Ayutthaya, Thailand, using the 10 essentials for making cities resilient modified by the United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction (UNDRR). Flood resilience assessment was performed based on a multi-criteria decision-making approach or the analytical hierarchy process (AHP) of pairwise comparison. The results indicate that runoff is considered the most influential factor in flood hazards, followed by land use, rainfall, and historical flood events, sequentially. Regarding the flood incident management concept, a questionnaire survey (n = 552) was conducted to understand the impacts of flood on local communities. The findings reveal that 50% of respondents had never received any flood information or participated in training sessions on flood preparedness. Most reported their concerns about the inadequate supply of drinking water during a flood. Spearman’s correlation coefficient shows positive correlations between flood disaster relief payments, preparedness training, access to flood hazard mapping, emergency health services, and their flood preparation actions. According to the modified UNDRR indicators, the top three highest AHP values in building community resilience to flood hazards in Ayutthaya are flood risk scenario identification, the effectiveness of emergency flood disaster response, integrated urban planning, and disaster risk reduction. The policy implications of this research include the need for national authorities to better understand the role cities can play a vital role in supporting both national and international climate resilience frameworks, especially Thailand’s National Disaster Management Plan, the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction (SFDRR), and the global Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).']"

It could serve as a colorimetric and fluorescent sensor for Hg2+ in aqueous acetonitrile solutions with high selectivity over other competitive metal ions. Upon Hg2+ titration, the sensor exhibited ""ON-OFF"" fluorescence quenching at 526 nm (λex 458 nm) and ""OFF-ON"" fluorescence enhancement at 560 nm (λex 530 nm), which were accompanied by a colorimetric change from yellow to red. The Hg2+ detection limit of the sensor was 0.7 ppb, which is lower than the permitted level of Hg2+ in drinking water regulated by US EPA and WHO. Additionally, the fluorescence quenching and fluorescence enhancement of the sensor in the presence of Hg2+ could provide a precise determination of Hg2+ concentration due to their self-calibration.

The target compounds are successfully synthesized in yields of 50–90% and characterized by 1H-NMR, 13C-NMR, and HRMS. The compound with an amino picolyl group (P1) exhibits an excellent selectivity toward Cu(II) ion as the fluorescent signal shifts from 433 to 630 nm. From a fluorescence titration experiment, the limit of detection for Cu(II) ion is estimated as 0.19 µm. The fluorescence spectral shift by Cu(II) ion is reliant on the use of acetonitrile as a co-solvent, and the results from cyclic voltammetry and UV-Vis spectroscopy suggest that the sensing mechanism involves a coordination complex between the P1, acetonitrile and Cu(II) ion.

Cellulose regenerated from the bagasse sugarcane was used for this study. Although cellulose and NR have a considerably low mutual affinity, composite hydrogels with various cellulose and NR contents were prepared using a wet-phase inversion method. The maximum amount of NR that can be loaded into the cellulose hydrogel was about 30% vol. Once NR is introduced into the cellulose hydrogels, the obtained hydrogel became translucent and eventually opaque with increasing NR loading. Measurements of water absorption, the water contact angle, and evaluation of fourier-transform infrared spectroscopoy (FTIR) spectra revealed that the presence of NR decreases the water affinity of the hydrogels. Nevertheless, it is noteworthy that the composite hydrogels had higher tensile strength and better elastic properties than the pristine hydrogel. The results showed that the obtained composite hydrogels can be elongated several times to their original length. The enhancement of both properties was proportional to the amount of NR included. Results of scanning electron microscope (SEM) images showed NR present inside the hollow of the cellulose hydrogel, forming interconnected domains. One can infer that the increase of mechanical and elastic properties is attributable to the presence of these interconnected structures.', ""Nanofibrillation and characterization of sugarcane bagasse agro-waste using water-based steam explosion and high-pressure homogenization  2020 Elsevier LtdSugarcane bagasse waste, consisting of approximately 40–50% cellulose, has been widely used in a number of industries.

Lines CSSL11, CSSL12, and CSSL16 containing the full putative salt tolerance genetic region were compared with the parental lines, ‘KDML105’ and DH212. The CSSL16 plants were significantly more salt-tolerant than the ‘KDML105’ rice plants. Therefore, the CSSL16 and ‘KDML105’ genome sequences were compared to identify additional potential introgressed regions. The major regions that differed between the two lines were located on chromosomes 1, 4, and 7. To identify candidate “major effect” genes, the different loci between CSSL16 and ‘KDML105’ plants were subjected to a co-expression network analysis, which detected 10 major hub genes. Six of these genes were determined to function in chloroplasts. The PsbS1 expression patterns were similar in CSSL16 and DH212 plants, but differed from that of ‘KDML105’ plants. Rice PsbS1 is a homolog of Arabidopsis thaliana CP22, which encodes a protein that binds to chlorophylls a and b. CP22 is localized in photosystem II and is responsible for non-photochemical quenching activities. Thus, the salt tolerance of knocked-out Arabidopsis thaliana mutant lines lacking CP22 was assessed. A mutation in CP22 increased the susceptibility of the mutant lines to salt stress. The cp22 mutants also exhibited decreased quantum yield efficiency of photosystem II (Fv/Fm) and inhibited growth relative to the wild-type plants grown under salt stress conditions.

Under drought and salinity stresses, plants share overlapping responsive mechanisms such as physiological changes and activation of signaling molecules, which induce and transmit signals through regulator genes in a regulatory network.

Physiological examination indicated that both CSSLs showed superior salt-tolerant level to KDML105. Our results suggested that salt tolerance ability of these CSSL lines may be resulted from high performance photosynthesis, better osmotic adjustment, and less oxidative stress damage under salt conditions.

To prevent salinity effects on rice yields, genetic diversity concerning salt tolerance must be evaluated. In this study, we investigated the salinity responses of rice (Oryza sativa) to determine the critical genes. The transcriptomes of ‘Luang Pratahn’ rice, a local Thai rice variety with high salt tolerance, were used as a model for analyzing and identifying the key genes responsible for salt-stress tolerance. Based on 3' Tag-Seq data from the time course of salt-stress treatment, weighted gene co-expression network analysis was used to identify key genes in gene modules. We obtained 1,386 significantly differentially expressed genes in eight modules. Among them, six modules indicated a significant correlation within 6, 12, or 48h after salt stress. Functional and pathway enrichment analysis was performed on the co-expressed genes of interesting modules to reveal which genes were mainly enriched within important functions for salt-stress responses. To identify the key genes in salt-stress responses, we considered the two-state co-expression networks, normal growth conditions, and salt stress to investigate which genes were less important in a normal situation but gained more impact under stress. We identified key genes for the response to biotic and abiotic stimuli and tolerance to salt stress. Thus, these novel genes may play important roles in salinity tolerance and serve as potential biomarkers to improve salt tolerance cultivars.""]"

The CFB reactor consists of two reactors including circulating fluidized bed riser (CFBR) and circulating fluidized bed downer (CFBD). The study focused on the CFBR as it was used in adsorption process. However, CO2 capture capacity is limited due to the equilibrium at the specific system temperature.

Three different reaction models including homogeneous model, deactivation model and equilibrium model were examined in order to validate the simulated CO2 adsorption performance. The results showed that the simulated data obtained from equilibrium model was found to be well correspondence with the experimental results. Thus, the equilibrium model was then applied in the CO2 desorption processes. To determine the significance of main operating parameter factors on a considered response, the central composite design (CCD) approach was used. The four factors of gas inlet velocity, solid circulation rate, temperature and water vapor content were selected as the independent factors for CO2 adsorption. The results showed that solid circulation rate and temperature were the two significant operating factors affecting the CO2 removal performance. Additionally, three factors, which were temperature, gas inlet velocity and solid circulation rate, were selected as independent factors on the desorbed CO2 mass fraction in the downer reactor. The simulated results showed that the most significant operating factors on the CO2 desorbed was gas inlet velocity. Consequently, the suitable operating conditions were proposed through the response surface method for both the CO2 adsorption and solid sorbent regeneration.', 'Development of computational fluid dynamics model for two initial CO2 concentration in circulating fluidized bed reactor  2019Nowadays, the global warming is considered as a world problem because it influences the environment by increasing the average temperature of earth surface.

Future studies should investigate a cost-effective means of integrating multidisciplinary approach interventions in routine hypertension care for elderly hypertensive patients.', 'Appearance and potential predictors of poorly controlled hypertension at the primary care level in an urban community  2018 Visanuyothin et al.Purpose: Hypertension (HT) is the major risk factor for cardiovascular diseases because of its poor control. To control HT at the primary care level in urban communities, there is a demand for deeper comprehension of the manifestations of poorly controlled HT. This study aimed to examine appearance of HT, including the association between the appearance and home blood pressure (HBP) control at the primary care level in urban communities. Patients and methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted in July-October 2017 in an urban community in Thailand. The total sample size from randomization was 125 poorly controlled HT patients who were diagnosed with an average clinic blood pressure ≥140/90 mmHg in their last three visits. Data were collected by face-to-face interviews, HBP monitoring (HBPM), and blood and urine testing. Data analysis was conducted via descriptive statistics and the chisquare tests, with a significance level of p<0.05. Results: HBPM revealed that 58.4% of patients with poorly controlled blood pressure from clinic measurement had a systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure that were below the HBP target. Most patients were overweight/obese, but they were nonsmokers and nondrinkers. As comorbidities, they had hyperlipidemia (64.0%) and diabetes mellitus (53.0%). One-quarter of them had good levels of knowledge and literacy. Nearly half had good health self-care literacy. Only 13% exhibited adequate self-management behaviors, but more than half had biochemistry results within normal limits. There were significant associations of smoking history and having hyperlipidemia as a comorbidity with HBP control (p =0.010 and 0.046, respectively). Conclusion: The role of HBPM is important in practice when it comes to monitoring HT control at the primary care level in an urban context. Smoking cessation and control of the blood lipid levels should be highlighted not only at the practice, but also at the policy level.', 'How a self-management program affects blood pressure among indonesians with hypertension: A quasi-experimental study  2022 Wolters Kluwer Medknow Publications. All rights reserved.Background: The prevalence of persons with hypertension remains high, especially in Southeast Asia, such as in Indonesia. Therefore, an effort to control blood pressure is needed. This study aimed to examine the effect of a self-management program on blood pressure among persons with hypertension in Indonesia. Materials and Methods: A quasi-experimental study with pre-Test post-Test with control group design was used. Seventy-seven participants were selected using convenience sampling in Belitung, Indonesia. A digital sphygmomanometer was used to measure blood pressure. Paired t-Test and independent t-Test were used for data analysis. Knowledge of hypertension, diet, exercise, and medication records were measured via validated questionnaires and observation sheets. Results: There was a significant effect of the eight-week self-management program on systolic blood pressure (t 30 = 6.45, p = 0.01) and diastolic blood pressure (t 30 = 2.53, p = 0.02). A significant difference in blood pressure was also identified between the experiment and control group, particularly in systolic blood pressure (t 59 =-2.89, p = 0.05) with a large effect size (0.71). Conclusions: Brisk walking with a duration of at least 30 minutes per day, dietary modification program specifically focusing on weight loss and anti-hypertensive food, monitoring program, and health education for eight weeks, are considered effective to control blood pressure among patients with hypertension, and these interventions should be a part of nursing interventions and sustainable health development programs in the community.']"

This community-integrated intermediary care (CIIC) model is a novel prevention-based, long-term care model enhancing the family-based care system traditionally practised in Thailand and neighbouring Asian countries, and many low-and middle-income countries globally. This study assessed the effectiveness of the CIIC model in Chiang Mai, Thailand. Methods: The two-arm parallel intervention study was designed as a cluster-randomized controlled trial. The study population at randomization and analysis was 2788 participants: 1509 in six intervention clusters and 1279 in six control clusters. The research protocol was approved by the WHO Research Ethics Review Committee (WHO/ERC ID; ERC.0003064). The CIIC service intervention model is a combination of formal care and informal care in a subdistrict setting consisting of three components: (1) care prevention delivered as community group exercise and home exercise; (2) care capacity-building of the family caregiver; and (3) community respite service. The primary outcome was family caregivers’ burden at 6-month follow-up, and secondary outcome was activities of daily living. Analysis applied the intention-to-treat approach using cluster-level analysis via STATA 16 SE. Results: Baseline characteristics did not differ between the two arms. Loss of follow up was 3.7%. Mean age of the participants was 69.53 years. Women constituted 60%. The COVID-19 pandemic caused delayed implementation. The proportion of families with reduced caregiver burden at 6-month follow-up was higher among the intervention clusters (mean 39.4%) than control clusters (mean 28.62%). The intervention clusters experienced less functional decline and fewer people with depression. Conclusions: When communities are integrated for preventing care, and families are empowered for giving care, it is possible to secure universal access to health and social care for the older persons, with basic resources mobilized from communities. This study had shown the CIIC model as an effective and potential step to the realization of universal health and long-term care coverage being inclusive of ageing populations in Thailand and globally.

Traditional family-based care, which has been the basis of most care for older people, is becoming unsustainable as families become smaller. In addition, women tend to be adversely affected as they still form the bulk of caregivers for older people, and many are likely to exit the labor market in order to provide care. Many family caregivers also have no or minimal training, and they may be called upon to provide quite complex care, increasing the proportion of older people receiving suboptimal care if they rely only on informal care that is provided by families and friends. Facing the increasing burden of noncommunicable diseases and age-related morbidity, Thai communities are increasingly in need of community-integrated care models for older persons that can link existing health systems and reduce the burden upon caring families. This need is common to many countries in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). Objective: In this study, we aimed to assess the effectiveness of a community-integrated intermediary care (CIIC) model to enhance family-based care for older people. Methods: This paper describes a cluster randomized controlled trial comprised of 6 intervention clusters and 6 control clusters that aim to recruit 2000 participants in each arm. This research protocol has been approved by the World Health Organization Ethics Review Committee. The intervention clusters will receive an integrated model of care structured around (1) a community respite service, (2) the strengthening of family care capacity, and (3) an exercise program that aims to prevent entry into long-term care for older people. Control group clusters receive usual care (ie, the current system of long-term care common to all provinces in Thailand), consisting principally of a volunteer-assisted home care service. The trial will be conducted over a period of 2 years. The primary outcome is family caregiver burden measured at a 6-month follow-up, as measured by the Caregiver Burden Inventory. Secondary outcomes consist of biopsychosocial indicators including functional ability, as measured using an activity of daily living scale; depression, as measured by the Geriatric Depression Scale; and quality of life of older people, as measured by the EuroQol 5-dimensions 5-levels scale. Intention-to-treat analysis will be followed. Results: The CIIC facility has been established. Community care prevention programs have been launched at the intervention clusters. Family caregivers are receiving training and assistance. However, the COVID-19 pandemic delayed the intervention. Conclusions: Since ASEAN and many Asian countries share similar traditional family-based, long-term care systems, the proposed CIIC model and the protocol for its implementation and evaluation may benefit other countries wishing to adopt similar community-integrated care models for older people at risk of needing long-term care.', 'Towards Cultural Adequacy of Experience-Based Design: A Qualitative Evaluation of Community-Integrated Intermediary Care to Enhance the Family-Based Long-Term Care for Thai Older Adults  2023 by the authors.In this qualitative study, we provided an in-depth understanding of how Community-Integrated Intermediary Care (CIIC), a new service model for family-based long-term care (LTC), was perceived by its users. The CIIC, established in Chiang Mai, Northern Thailand, consisted of three main interventions: (1) A temporary respite care center; (2) A family-centered care capacity building; (3) Functional training delivered as community group exercise and home exercise to improve healthy ageing for independent older adults. Ten pairs of dependent Thai older adults, their primary family caregivers, and ten village health volunteers were recruited using the purposive sampling method. Data were collected via semistructured in-depth interviews. A thematic descriptive qualitative analysis was used for data analysis. The findings revealed that CIIC helped reduce the burden of family caregivers by providing respite, relief, and care coordination. The experiences of the CIIC users indicated possibilities for service redesign, development, and delivery strategies to better meet the LTC needs of older adults and family caregivers. Following the local stakeholders’ commitment and local community health volunteers’ network, a well-integrated formal and informal care CIIC model can be implied as an effective and sustainable ageing care service model in Thailand and other Asian countries in the future.']"

The number of services at the edge of IoT is rising rapidly due to the prevalent uses of smart devices and cyber-physical systems (CPSs). To explore the promising applications of IoT services, one of the challenges is to enable the interoperability of the services in a decentralized environment. The blockchain technology (BCT) has been proven as a promising solution to establish the trust of data and call for executions; theoretically, it can be used to support the interoperability of services. BCT verifies data or a process and stores it as a transaction in a distributed ledger. Similar to the topology to IoT, applying BCT at the edges of the network exhibits the distributed characteristic. However, currently, BCT is still facing the challenges for interoperability due to a number of factors such as consensus protocols, block sizes, and interval of blocks. Prominent protocols such as proof-of-work (PoW) may cause excessive delays in finality settlement. One promising protocol Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerant offers a fast finality settlement and uses hyperledger to support the scalability; however, the trust might also be a concern if the validators are chosen improperly. This paper discusses the interoperability of IoT services and the challenges and proposes an architecture solution by integrating BCT, service-oriented architecture (SoA), and enablers of key performance indicators (KPIs) and service selections. The proposed architecture aims to solve both interoperability and trust issues for IoT services. The feasibility of the proposed method is validated by the examples of smart contract implementations.', 'Application of Blockchain in Collaborative Internet-of-Things Services  2014 IEEE.Innovating business processes involves cutting-edge technologies where the Internet of Things (IoT) and Blockchain are technological breakthroughs. IoT is envisioned as a global network infrastructure consisting of numerous connected devices over the Internet. Many attempts have been made to improve and adapt business workflows for best utilizing IoT services. One possible solution is to digitize and automate internal processes using IoT services, in which Blockchain smart contract is a viable solution to establish the trust of process executions without intermediaries. Modern business processes are composed of disparate services; many of them tend to be delivered based on IoT. Interoperating with such services poses major challenges: 1) time for finality settlement of transactions is unpredictable and usually experiencing delay; 2) several implementations of permissioned Blockchain pose a major concern of trust regarding nodes that perform consensus; and 3) trust of process executions and IoT information is the major factor to the success of modern business processes, which require the composition of distributed IoT services. Traditional business processes are mostly managed by a single entity, which induces the problem of trust of process executions. In this paper, a smart contract for establishing the trust of process executions that fits into the IoT environment is presented. A consensus approach with selected validators extended from Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT) is introduced to address time and prejudice challenges.', 'When blockchain meets Internet of Things: Characteristics, challenges, and business opportunities  2019 Elsevier Inc.Researches in Blockchain Technology (BCT) and Internet of Things (IoT) are experiencing exponential growth in recent years. They are being witnessed as mainstream technologies that have the potential of revolutionizing our society. However, these two contain technologically unrelated in philosophies. This article has a special interest in exploring how BCT and IoT can benefit in innovating business models. The purpose of this work is to understand the state of the art how BCT can be utilized within IoT context to create secure decentralized architecture. IoT is not secure by design, making its applications vulnerable especially to security and privacy threats. This hinders the proliferation of IoT applications in a large scale. With BCT capabilities, BCT can be used as integral part that can solve many shortcomings of IoT applications. Thus, existing businesses can be improved, and new business models can be brought into reality. Eliminating the need of third parties to guarantee trust of business transactions is a significant value towards business innovation in many areas, such as digital supply chain, vehicular systems, surveillance systems, and the creation of new business models, e.g. sharing economy, local energy trading, smart city, to name but a few. In an effort to understand the state of the art, this article (1) highlights intrinsic characteristics of IoT, (2) describes BCT modes and their characteristics to be considered for IoT integration, (3) presents a comprehensive survey on business opportunities based on the usage of BCT and IoT from a wide variety of literatures, (4) analyse strengths and weaknesses, and (5) discusses research possibilities that can be a solution to the problems.

All rights reserved.This paper presents a novel cable-driven robotic joint for a gait exoskeleton robot. We discussed in detail a lightweight, low inertia, and highly back-drivable, 1-DOF tension amplification mechanism based on a pulley system and block-and-tackle technique. The exoskeleton is controlled using an impedance controller under the active-assistive and resistive approaches. Four experiments were conducted to evaluate the proposed exoskeleton’s safety and controller performance: mechanical transparency analysis, active-assistive trajectory tracking, resistance of trajectory tracking, and gait rehabilitation. The exoskeleton demonstrated high transparency with the root mean square (RMS) torque of 0.457 Nm under no-load condition, suggesting that the mechanism is highly back-drivable, has a low moment of inertia, and is mechanically safe to operate. The active-assistive trajectory tracking experiment indicated that the output torque was generated under assist-as-needed approach, as the average robotic-assistance torque was lowered by more than 73% when the user provided assistance force to complete the task on their own. Additionally, the resistance experiment revealed the feasibility of employing the exoskeleton to strengthen muscles with adjustable resistive torque from 0.94 Nm and 2.25 Nm.

Here we report on our effort employing the concept of adjustable unsupported-length cantilever leaf spring, which has been previously applied to different designs of variable stiffness actuators. By transmitting the interaction force through the elastic component directly to the supporting structure instead of the actuation unit, this type of actuator requires low power to adjust and to maintain a desired stiffness. In the design of a 1-translational degree of freedom body weight support system of a rehabilitation robot, we used a leaf spring mechanism for stiffness modulation relying only on the spring deflection in combination with a non-backdrivable actuator for adjusting the vertical equilibrium position. This paper describes our approach in determining the spring parameters to attain a desired range of stiffness with a short traveling distance of the adjuster. To model the spring stiffness under deflection, the ideal cantilever support model cannot be assumed for a conventional design of dual roller-pairs slider, especially with a soft spring. A beam deflection model considering the non-zero slopes at the contact points between the rollers and the spring is presented, along with the validation experiments using different spring thicknesses on our prototype.', 'Work in the Time of Covid-19: Actuators and Sensors for Rehabilitation Robotics  2022 The Institute of Electrical Engineers of Japan.This paper reports on our work conducted during 2020 in the development of actuation and sensing techniques and devices. In gait rehabilitation, active body weight support systems are often needed to guarantee the safety of patients. These support systems are required to operate at two distinct operation points: A high-force operating mode to hold a patient and prevent falls and, conversely, a ""transparent mode""that reduces the mechanical impedance of high-force actuators to enable patients, even those who are weak or paralyzed, to easily express movement. However, the ability to deliver high forces and easily manipulate robots is a key challenge in improving the force-based interaction control. Force feedback is an effective approach to reduce the inertia and friction of robots, but stability is paramount particularly when interacting with humans. By modeling the environment as a second-order spring-mass-damper system and considering the phase response, we derived the control parameter gains required to guarantee a stable human-robot interaction. The design of actuators with intrinsically adjustable mechanical properties is a complementary strategy. For instance, the stiffness of actuators can be modulated by adjusting the unsupported length of a cantilever leaf spring. To model the spring stiffness under deflection, an ideal cantilever support model cannot be assumed for a conventional design of a slider with dual roller pairs, particularly with a soft spring. We proposed a beam deflection model considering the non-zero slopes at the contact points between the rollers and spring. The spring parameters were determined to attain the desired range of stiffness with a short traveling distance of the adjuster. For a single degree-offreedom (DOF) linear motion, we investigated a macro-mini actuation concept using an electrorheological-fluid brake. Balancing these conflicting requirements between the driving force generated from the non-backdrivable high-force unit and the low-inertia and low-friction unit was achieved by controlling the electrical field affecting the fluid yield stress between the rotor and stator electrodes of the brake. One of the limitations of the feedback control scheme was noisy force sensors. We discuss our novel proximity and force sensor using optical techniques and conclude with a description of low-profile 3-DOF flat motor.']"

In this paper, we apply the upwind finite volume method for solving the ion flow field of three HVDC configurations to clarify the effect of the wind and the role of shielding conductors. For the monopolar configuration installation, the ground current distribution with underbuilt shield wires was studied numerically and experimentally. For the ±250 kV bipolar configuration, the calculated peak electric field and current density are verified with the values in a reference. The ±500 kV bipolar configuration is used to investigate the change in electric field and ion current within the same corridors of the existing HVAC lines. We analyze the ion flow field with and without the dedicated metallic return conductor (DMRC). In the absence of wind, the maximum of the electric field is lower than that of the HVAC lines and the current density is very low on the ground. In the presence of wind, the electric field and the current distribution become unsymmetrical on the ground level. The peak current density increases significantly on the downwind side. The HVDC line without DMRC has the electric field peak higher than that of the HVAC lines. With the higher wind shear coefficient, the peak of the electric field and the current density increases on the downwind side. Overall investigations summarize that DMRC can effectively reduce the peak of the electric field to be lower than that of the existing 500 kV HVAC lines under all wind conditions.', 'Electromechanical Analysis of Red Blood Cell under AC Electric Field  1965-2012 IEEE.This article presents the numerical analysis of electromechanics of a red blood cell under electric field in a microchannel.

The aim of this work is to investigate the variation in electric field frequency of the DEP force on the cell in different orientations and to clarify cell behavior during the transition between the positive and negative dielectrophoresis, which is important for on-chip cell manipulation. We use the boundary element method and apply the boundary condition of transmembrane potential on the cell membrane for calculation. The simulation results show that the DEP characteristics depend highly on the orientation and the position of the cell from electrode edge.

The thickness of the oil film between drops decreases and ruptures. As a consequence, the drops coalesce together. However, if the electric field is too high, the resultant drop deforms and disintegrates, reducing the efficiency of the electrocoalescence process. In this work, a multiple-physic simulation is performed to determine the critical electric field that causes the disintegration of an aqueous drop. The configuration is an aqueous drop, located on a grounded electrode in an insulating oil under an electric field. We numerically analyze the deformation and disintegration of a drop under the applied electric field using the finite element method. We use the level set method to track the interface between the aqueous drop and the insulating oil. The results show that the aqueous drop elongates due to the electric force and starts to deform under 0.36 kV/mm electric field. The elongation and the deformation of drop increase with the electric field. Eventually, the aqueous drop completely loses its stability at the critical field value, which is equal to 0.9 kV/mm. An experiment is conducted to observe the disintegration of drop. The experimental results demonstrate that the drop disintegration occurs at the average electric field of 1.02 kV/mm, slightly higher than the critical field obtained from the simulation.']"

Therefore, parameterization of the state-feedback controllers is independent of the Lyapunov matrices. The proposed design condition is bilinear in the decision variables, and hence we provide an iterative algorithm to solve the design problem.

This study aimed to evaluate the effect of additional analgesic methods combined with periarticular injection (PAI) analgesia for TKA. Methods: Using retrospective cohort data, patients undergoing TKA with spinal anesthesia and PAI were divided into 4 groups. Group A (control) comprised 66 patients; group B (73 patients) had additional adductor canal block; group C (70 patients) obtained additional femoral nerve block, and group D (73 patients) received additional adductor canal block and intrathecal morphine. Propensity score matching was applied to compare visual analog scale (VAS) for pain intensity, cumulative morphine use (CMU), knee flexion angle, straight leg raise, length of hospital stay, and postoperative nausea and vomiting. Results: There was no significant difference regarding VAS and morphine use, when either group B or C was compared with group A. Group D had significantly lower VAS than groups A, B, and C during the first 24 hours after surgery and required significantly less CMU than groups A and B. However, the pain score of group D increased afterward, with significantly longer length of hospital stay than groups A and B. There was no difference in straight leg raise among the groups.

We hypothesized that the combination of obturator nerve block (ONB) and tibial nerve block (TNB) would reduce pain and opioid consumption more than ONB or TNB alone when combined with continuous adductor canal block and LIA. Methods: Ninety patients were recruited into the study and received spinal anesthesia, LIA, and continuous adductor canal block. They were further randomized to receive either an ONB (group 1), a TNB (group 2), or both (group 3). The primary outcome was total morphine consumption over the postoperative 24 hours. The secondary outcomes included visual analog scale scores, time to first and total dosage of rescue analgesia, Timed Up and Go test, range of motion, muscle strength test, hospital stay, and patient satisfaction. Results: Eighty-nine patients completed analysis. The median total morphine consumption during the first 24 postoperative hours was 2 mg (interquartile range [IQR] 0-4) in group 3, 4 mg (IQR 2-8) in group 2, and 6 mg (IQR 6-14) in group 1 (P <.001). Posterior knee pain during the first 24 hours postoperatively was significantly lower in group 3 than in group 1 (P =.006).

Adductor canal block (ACB) and local infiltration analgesia (LIA) have become increasingly involved in postoperative pain management after TKA. We aimed to compare their efficacy and outcomes in patients undergoing TKA. Materials and Methods: Sixty patients undergoing unilateral TKA were randomized to receive either postoperative single-injection ACB (Group A) or LIA (Group L) during the operation. All patients received spinal anaesthesia. Primary outcome was total morphine consumption over postoperative 24 hours. Visual analog pain scale, time to first and total dosage of rescue analgesia, performance-based evaluations [timed-up and go (TUG) test, quadriceps strength], side-effects, length of hospital stay and patient satisfaction were measured. Results: Fifty-seven patients were available for analysis. Median total morphine consumption over 24 and 48 postoperative hours of Group A were significantly less than Group L (6/10 mg vs 13/25 mg, p, 0.008 and 0.001, respectively). Similarly, Group A had significantly lower VAS at postoperative 6, 12 and 18 hours, VAS at ambulation on postoperative (POD) 1-3, better TUG tests on POD 2 and during POD 3 than those of Group L. However, quadriceps strength and patient satisfaction were not different between both groups. Conclusion: Patients undergoing TKA with single-injection ACB required less postoperative opioids than those with LIA. Furthermore, multimodal analgesia using ACB provided better postoperative analgesia, as well as performance-based activities, than those with LIA.']"

Among these, bimetallic 2%Ni-X%Cu/SiO2 (X = 2, 5) catalysts exhibited better catalytic performances than monometallic 2%Ni/SiO2 and 2%Cu/SiO2. Moreover, the bimetallic 2%Ni-5%Cu/SiO2 catalyst showed the best catalytic performance with 94% of furfural conversion and 64% of furfuryl alcohol selectivity.

Although HMF can be produced in high yield from fructose dehydration, fructose is rather expensive because it requires multiple processing steps. On the other hand, HMF can be produced directly from highly abundant glucose, which could reduce time and cost. However, an effective and multifunctional catalyst is needed to selectively promote the glucose-to-HMF reaction. In this work, we report a bifunctional phosphated titanium dioxide as an efficient catalyst for such a reaction. The best catalyst exhibits excellent catalytic performance for the glucose conversion to HMF with 72% yield and 83% selectivity in the biphasic system. We achieve this by tuning the solvent system, controlling the amount of Brønsted and Lewis acid sites on the catalyst, and modification of the reaction setup. From the analysis of acid sites, we found that the addition of phosphate group (Brønsted acid site) onto the surface of TiO2(Lewis acid site) significantly enhanced the HMF yield and selectivity when the optimum ratio of Brønsted and Lewis acid sites is reached. The high catalytic activity, good reusability, and simple preparation method of the catalyst show a promise for the potential use of this catalytic system on an industrial scale.', 'Selective synthesis of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural over natural rubber–derived carbon/silica nanocomposites with acid–base bifunctionality  2021 Elsevier Ltd5-Hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) is an important platform molecule, derived from biomass-based carbohydrates, for the production of renewable fuel additives, liquid hydrocarbon fuels, biopolymers, and specialty chemicals. In this study, a mesoporous carbon/silica (MCS) nanocomposite, as catalyst support, was prepared using a nanocomposite of natural rubber (NR) and hexagonal mesoporous silica (HMS) as a precursor. To obtain a series of acidic, basic, and bifunctional acid-base catalysts, the MCS surface was modified using post-synthesis methods in which the carbon moieties were decorated with sulfonic acid groups, whereas the silica matrix surface was grafted with 3-aminopropyl groups. The resulting materials exhibited high surface area, large pore volume, and contain some oxygen-containing functional groups. Their acid-base properties were tunable by varying the content of sulfonic acid and aminopropyl groups. The HMF was synthesized by catalytic conversion of fructose and glucose in a biphasic medium. Fructose dehydration catalyzed by sulfonated MCS catalyst (MCS-SO3H) at 150 °C for 2 h yields 56% HMF at 81% conversion. For the glucose system, the Brønsted basic sites facilitated the glucose–fructose isomerization, however, it promoted the formation of undesired humins. The acid/base ratio of bifunctional MCS catalysts (MCS-SO3H-NH2) contributes to the HMF yield and selectivity. The HMF yield of 39.4% was obtained over the MCS-SO3H-NH2 catalyst with an acid/base ratio of 0.10 at 190 °C for 1 h. In both systems, the formation of levulinic acid, a byproduct of HMF hydrolysis, was suppressed due to the hydrophobicity of the MCS catalyst. These developed catalysts are promising for the synthesis of HMF from glucose, at high substrate concentration than those reported in the literature.']"

In this study, a concept of a drift-flux model is adopted to develop a predictive method for the oil fraction in the horizontal oil-water flows due to its simplicity and practicality. A new drift-flux correlation for the horizontal oil-water flows is developed based on the least square method using collected experimental data. The distribution parameter is determined to be 1.05 for the data with the ratio of oil density to water density ranging from 0.787 to 1.00, whereas the oil fraction weighted mean drift velocity is set at 0 m/s due to the flow direction perpendicular to the gravity direction. The physical meaning for the order of unity of the distribution parameter is explained by introducing a simple model. The predictive capability of the new drift-flux correlation is examined using the collected database of oil-water flows in horizontal pipes under a variety of test conditions. It is demonstrated that the new drift-flux correlation can predict the existing oil fractions in the horizontal pipe channels with the mean absolute error, standard deviation, mean relative deviation, and mean absolute relative deviation being 0.0124, 0.0338,-3.25%, and 9.57%, respectively.', 'Channel size effect on drift-flux parameters for adiabatic and boiling two-phase flows  2021 Elsevier LtdGas-liquid two-phase flows are utilized in various heat and mass transfer processes that appear in numerous industrial apparatus. Typical examples are chemical reactors, heat exchangers, nuclear reactors, deaerators, condensers, etc. The numerical simulation of gas-liquid two-phase flows, which is crucial for efficient, safe, and optimized apparatus design, requires an accurate model developed based on the physics of the two-phase fluid dynamics. The two-fluid model is considered the most accurate two-phase conservation equations used in computer simulation codes to predict the thermal-hydraulic behavior of two-phase flows. The drift-flux parameters, such as the distribution parameter and drift velocity in the drift-flux model, are utilized in formulating the interfacial drag force in the two-fluid model-based simulation codes. The drift-flux model is an insightful model considering the difference between gas and liquid velocities. The effect of phase and velocity distributions on the void fraction is considered through the two drift-flux parameters. The distribution parameter and drift velocity are critical parameters in the two-phase flow formulation through the two-fluid model, which are the backbone of thermal-hydraulic analysis codes. The constitutive equations for the distribution parameter and drift velocity developed for medium-size channels reach a mature level but do not apply to industrial-size channels or large-size channels. The complicated two-phase flow dynamics in large-size channels affect the distribution parameter and drift velocity significantly. The distribution parameter in a large-size channel increases at low pressure and low liquid flow conditions due to induced secondary flow in the large-size channel. The drift velocity also increases due to cap bubbles formed by the surface instability of large bubbles. Multi-dimensional two-phase flow dynamics observed in large-size channels complicate the distribution parameter and drift velocity modeling. Thus, the drift-flux modeling in large-size channels is a much more subtle task than that in medium-size channels. This fact has driven the research to establish the drift-flux type correlations by modeling the distribution parameter and drift velocity in large-size channels. The current paper aims to provide state-of-the-art knowledge of the current status of the recent development of the drift-flux type correlations in large-size channels. The discussed items cover the formulation of the one-dimensional drift-flux model, typical drift-flux correlations developed for medium-size channels, distribution parameters for subcooled and saturated boiling flows, unique two-phase flow dynamics in large-size channels, critical size at the boundary between medium and large-size channels, and existing drift-flux correlations for large-size channels. The flow channel geometries discussed in the current paper are circular, annulus, rectangular, square, vertical rod bundle, and horizontal tube bundle. The future research direction is also discussed.', 'Drift-flux correlation for gas-liquid two-phase flow in a horizontal pipe  2017 Elsevier Inc.A drift-flux correlation has been often used to predict void fraction of gas-liquid two-phase flow in a horizontal channel due to its simplicity and practicality. The drift-flux correlation includes two important drift-flux parameters, namely, the distribution parameter and void-fraction-weighted-mean drift velocity. In this study, an extensive literature survey for horizontal two-phase flow is conducted to establish void fraction database and to acquire existing drift-flux correlations. A total of 566 data is collected from 12 data sources and 4 flow-regime-dependent and 1 flow-regime-independent drift-flux correlations are identified. The predictive capability of the existing drift-flux correlations is assessed using the collected data. It is pointed out that the drift velocity determined by a regression analysis may include a significant error due to a compensation error between distribution parameter and drift velocity. In this study, a simple flow-regime-independent drift-flux correlation is developed. In the modeling approach, the void-fraction-weighted mean drift velocity is approximated to be 0 m/s, whereas the distribution parameter is given as a simple function of the ratio of non-dimensional superficial gas velocity to non-dimensional mixture volumetric flux. The newly developed correlation shows an excellent predictive capability of void fraction for horizontal two-phase flow. Mean absolute error (or bias), standard deviation (random error), mean relative deviation and mean absolute relative deviation of the correlation are 0.0487, 0.0985, 0.0758 and 0.206, respectively. The prediction accuracy of the correlation is similar to the correlation of Chexal et al. (1991), which was formulated based on the drift-flux parameters by means of many cascading constitutive relationships with numerous empirical parameters.']"

This study investigates different pathways through which parenthood influences happiness, using a large sample of older adults (N = 85,477) in a developing country in Asia, Thailand, drawn from three waves of a nationally representative survey. It hypothesizes that happiness in old age is a function not only of parenthood but also of one’s financial status, health status, and social participation, and parenthood is linked with each of the latter three components. The study suggests that parenthood is associated directly with an increase of 1.48% in the level of self-assessed, older-age happiness and indirectly with an increase of 0.66% through its associations with the other three domains of happiness. The mediation effects are strongest through the financial pathway, followed by the health and the social participation pathways respectively. The results are consistent with previous studies in countries where non-family institutions that are intended to provide social security are relatively weak. In order to promote older-age well-being, this study recommends policies encouraging post-retirement financial independence, health-promotion programs, and the provision of community-based activities targeted at older people.', 'Preparations for Old Age and Well-Being in Later Life in Thailand: Gender Matters?  2016,  The Author(s) 2016.Data from the 2011 Survey of Older Persons in Thailand examines the association between preparations for old age (financial, health, caregiving, living arrangements, and spiritual) and three measures of well-being: financial satisfaction, life satisfaction, and physical health.

Multivariate logistic regression analyses indicate that different forms of preparation are positively associated with post-retirement well-being for men and women but socioeconomic resources are positively associated with all three well-being outcomes. Furthermore, for women, there are significant negative interaction effects of income and financial preparation on life satisfaction, as well as negative interaction effects of disability and caregiver preparation on self-rated health.

We show that retirement increases satisfaction with the amount of leisure time up to two years prior to retiring. Upon retirement, individuals reported higher satisfaction with their income and leisure. For leisure the well-being boost did not dissipate over time, but for income satisfaction adaptation was complete. These findings provide new empirical evidence on the causal link between retirement and well-being and suggest that such link may be better understood as a three-stage process occurring before, during and after retirement.']"

This area of inquiry has not been fully investigated in the literature. Background: Employee turnover, particularly of professionals, becomes a very challenging issue. It continually affects organizations in terms of resourcing and developmental costs, manpower instability, day-to-day operations, perception of quality care and efficiency. Therefore, employees' working attitude and behaviour have drawn increasing attention for further research to determine which factors keep them with their employer. Design: A cross-sectional survey was conducted with self-report questionnaires. Methods: Data were collected from 1,966 nurses from sixteen private general hospitals in Thailand during February–June 2016. Hypotheses were tested and analysed by means of a confirmatory factor analysis, structural equation modelling and a bootstrapping procedure. Results: The results revealed the direct relationship between leader-member exchange quality and job embeddedness. Organizational identification played an intermediary role that partially mediated the relationship between leader-member exchange quality on job embeddedness. Analysis also provided support for the mediating effect of organizational identification and turnover intention through job embeddedness. Conclusion: This study extends the job embeddedness theory and gains understanding of the antecedent factors that directly and indirectly cause employees to become embedded and lead to predict turnover intention. The findings are pertinent, as few studies have investigated such relationships. The implications provide insights into how organizations can better retain their workforce."", 'The moderating effects of demographic characteristics and certain psychological factors on the job embeddedness – turnover relationship among Thai health-care employees  2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.Purpose: This paper aims to investigate the roles of demographic characteristics (i.e. generations and organizational tenure) and psychological factors (i.e. leader-member exchange and self-efficacy) as moderators of the relationship between job embeddedness and turnover intention, and the mediating effect of turnover intention between job embeddedness and actual turnover. Design/methodology/approach: Data were collected from 422 health-care workers through a questionnaire survey and analyzed by means of a confirmatory factor analysis and hierarchical regression. Findings: The results reveal that less embedded employees who perceive a lower level of leader–member exchange quality are more likely to indicate an intention to leave. The negative relationship between job embeddedness and turnover intention is stronger among less embedded employees with high self-efficacy. The finding also indicates that turnover intention plays a significant mediating role in the relationship between job embeddedness and actual turnover. Research limitations/implications: The current research took place within two health-care organizations. Replicating the study in a variety of industries, professions or cultures would be useful for the generalizability of the findings. Practical implications: Organizations may improve their retention of employees by nurturing the leader–member exchange relationship to enhance a social web that bonds them together. Managers may need to pay attention to making a greater effort to embed individuals in their jobs, so that they are better able to cope successfully with challenges and organize the workday to accommodate them. Originality/value: This study examines the moderating roles of individual characteristics and psychological factors on the relationship between job embeddedness and turnover intention, which has not been extensively investigated in the literature.', 'Examining the relationships between HR practices, organizational job embeddedness, job satisfaction, and quit intention: Evidence from Thai accountants  2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to extend job embeddedness research by investigating employees’ perception of human resource (HR) practices as the predictors of organizational job embeddedness, and its mediating role between HR practices and quit intention. It also assesses the moderating effect of job satisfaction on the job embeddedness-turnover relationship. Design/methodology/approach: Data were collected through a questionnaire survey from 1,028 accountants in various disciplines from one of the largest corporations in Thailand, including its numerous subsidiaries and joint ventures. Hypotheses were tested and analyzed by means of a confirmatory factor analysis, multiple regressions, and a bootstrapping procedure. Findings: The results reveal that all HR practices except training are positively related to organizational job embeddedness. Analysis also provides support for the mediating effects on quit intention of two HR practices, namely rewards and career development, through organizational job embeddedness. In addition, the interaction effect shows that the negative relationship between organizational job embeddedness and quit intention reduces when job satisfaction is high. Research limitations/implications: The current research took place among accountants. Replicating the study in a variety of business sectors, professions, or cultures would be useful for the generalizability of the findings. Practical implications: Several HR strategies and tactics can help improve employee loyalty. Particularly effective are attractive rewards that reflect work values, and a promising career roadmap. Organizations might need to consider work conditions that sustain job satisfaction for turnover prevention in the short-term, and continuously manage long-term retention through embeddedness. Originality/value: This study extends current research by investigating the relationships of so far untested theorized antecedents that clarify how employees become embedded in the workplace in order to keep them from quitting.']"

Here, we analyzed water budgets of pine forests worldwide. We first estimated local water balance of forests dominated by two wide-ranging species: Pinus taeda (36 °N) and Pinus sylvestris (64 °N). In these stands, growing season evapotranspiration (ET) was largely insensitive to inter-annual variation of precipitation (P), consistent with the insensitivity of canopy transpiration to P. Extending the analyses to include published data from 117 studies on 27 pine species, we found that pine forests annually use ∼66% ± 17% (SD) of P as ET, regardless of climatic regime, leaving a third of P as runoff to downstream aquatic ecosystems and users. However, during the growing season, pine forests used more water as ET than P in regions where P ≤ 326 ± 39 (SE) mm. Forests in regions of low growing season P exist in their current state only where the rooting depth is sufficient to supply trees with water from soil storage in addition to P, and these forests are likely to support only ephemeral streams that dry down during the growing season. Thus, globally, water use by pine forests is adapted to mean annual P, but shows a limited capacity to respond to inter-annual variability in P. Forests with a small buffer of growing season water availability (P + soil water storage - ET), are likely to be most sensitive to variation in P regimes, changing canopy leaf area, tree density, and species composition depending on the degree, direction and persistence of the change in P.', 'Variation of leaf-level gas exchange rates and leaf functional traits of dominant trees across three successional stages in a Southeast Asian tropical forest  2021 Elsevier B.V.Deforestation has created heterogeneous patches of old-growth and secondary forests throughout Southeast Asia, posing challenges for understanding the hydrological and carbon cycles. In addition to changes in species composition, environmental conditions differ across successional stages which in turn can influence forest water use and productivity. Here, we investigated leaf-level area-based photosynthesis (Aarea) and stomatal conductance (gs) of 11 tree species dominating an old-growth (OF; >200 years), an intermediate (IF; ~44 years), and a young forest (YF; ~4 years) in Thailand during both the wet and dry season. Specifically, we compared Aarea and gs and assessed the sensitivity of gs to vapor pressure deficit (VPD). We also examined relationships between gas exchange parameters and key functional leaf traits, including leaf mass per area (LMA), nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and chlorophyll concentration. All three forests showed comparable Aarea and gs in the wet season, whereas significantly lower values were observed in IF during the dry season. All forest stages displayed similar sensitivity of gs to VPD. Among the leaf functional traits considered, LMA, N and P were significantly higher in YF compared to the other two successional stages. Our results suggested that forest succession may not influence gas exchange, rather, canopy development associated with forest stage produced the main effect. Furthermore, the young forest was the most active in resource acquisition with its high LMA and leaf nutrient concentrations, which could result in high photosynthetic rates. However, low soil water availability in YF possibly limit the gas exchange rates thereby making them similar to those in the old-growth forest. These findings highlight the potential effects of canopy characteristics inherent in successional forests on water and carbon exchanges between trees and the atmosphere and their sensitivity to atmospheric drought. These results call for the need for further studies to identify the main factors influencing forest productivity during secondary succession in the tropics, particularly in the Southeast Asian region where such information is lacking.', 'Variations in leaf water status and drought tolerance of dominant tree species growing in multi-aged tropical forests in Thailand  2022, The Author(s).Large-scale abandoned agricultural areas in Southeast Asia resulted in patches of forests of multiple successions and characteristics, challenging the study of their responses to environmental changes, especially under climatic water stress. Here, we investigated seasonal variation in leaf water status and drought tolerance of dominant tree species in three multi-aged tropical forests, ranging from 5 to > 200 years old, with contrasting soil moisture in Thailand. Seasonal variation in leaf water status differed among the forests with trees in young and intermediate sites demonstrating larger differences between seasons than the old-growth forest. Although vulnerability to embolism curves revealed that trees in old-growth forest were potentially more sensitive to declining leaf water status than others, they were predicted to lose < 5% of their hydraulic capacity as opposed to 13% for the trees in the younger sites. Our results suggest that the responses to water stress of tree species in different forest ages greatly vary with a tendency of trees in younger sites to be more resilience than those in older sites. Such information would benefit the selection of tree species that could adapt well to specific environments, thus improving the strategies for managing forests of different ages under a warmer future.']"

This study reveals the diverse bacterial communities of marine sponges collected from the Thailand coast by using 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. Functional predictions using Tax4Fun2 indicated that the sponge bacterial communities have the potential for crude oil degradation. In this work, two nonpathogenic crude oil-degrading bacteria, Sphingobium naphthae MO2-4 and Bacillus aryabhattai TL01-2, isolated from the sponges Chalinula sp. and Clathria reinwardti, respectively, were selected to construct a bacterial consortium named MOTL. The results showed that the strains MO2-4 and TL01-2 had biosurfactant producing abilities and each had the ability to adhere to hydrocarbons. These strains also demonstrated capacities for surviving in the presence of various heavy metals. Moreover, strain MO2-4 contained genes encoding hydrocarbon-degrading enzymes. Consortium MOTL achieved 64%, 63%, and 51% degradation efficiencies for 2000 mg L-1 crude oil, diesel oil, and fuel oil, respectively, within 7 days and still maintained its degradation capacity when the concentration of petroleum oil increased to 8000 mg L-1. The consortium could degrade phenanthrene, tetradecane and a mixture of phenanthrene and tetradecane, and its degradation efficiencies were more effective than those of the individual strains. Consequently, the consortium MOTL is a promising candidate for the full-scale application of petroleum bioremediation in the presence of heavy metals.', 'Bioaugmentation with zeolite-immobilized bacterial consortium OPK results in a bacterial community shift and enhances the bioremediation of crude oil-polluted marine sandy soil microcosms  2021 Elsevier LtdA pyrene-degrading consortium OPK containing Mycolicibacterium strains PO1 and PO2, Novosphingobium pentaromativorans PY1 and Bacillus subtilis FW1 effectively biodegraded medium- and long-chain alkanes as well as mixed hydrocarbons in crude oil. The detection of alkB and CYP153 genes in the genome of OPK members supports its phenotypic ability to effectively degrade a broad range of saturated hydrocarbons in crude oil. Zeolite-immobilized OPK was developed as a ready-to-use bioproduct and it exhibited 74% removal of 1000 mg L−1 crude oil within 96 h in sterilized seawater without nutrient supplementation and maintained high crude oil-removal activity under a broad range of pH values (5.0–9.0), temperatures (30–40 °C) and salinities (20–60‰). In addition, the immobilized OPK retained a high crude oil removal efficacy in semicontinuous experiments and showed reusability for at least 5 cycles. Remarkably, bioaugmentation with zeolite-immobilized OPK in sandy soil microcosms significantly increased crude oil (10,000 mg kg−1 soil) removal from 45% to 80.67% within 21 days compared to biostimulation and natural attenuation. Moreover, bioaugmentation with exogenous immobilized OPK stimulated an increase in the relative abundances of Alcanivorax genus, indigenous hydrocarbon-degrading bacteria, which in turn enhanced removal efficiency of crude oil contamination from sandy soil microcosms. The results indicate positive interactions between the bioaugmented immobilized consortium, harboring Mycolicibacterium as a key player, and indigenous Alcanivorax, which exhibited crucial functions for improving crude oil removal efficacy.

In this study, the removal of crude oil from seawater by immobilized bacterial consortium was performed and the enhancement of crude oil degradation efficiency by varying immobilization methods and inoculum volume ratio was examined. The nonpathogenic and heavy metal-tolerant bacterial consortium of Sphingobium naphthae MO2-4 and Priestia aryabhattai TL01-2 was immobilized by biofilm formation on aquaporousgels. The simultaneous immobilization of strains MO2-4 and TL01-2 showed better crude oil removal efficiency than independent immobilization, which indicated positive interactions among consortium members in the mixed-culture immobilized systems. Moreover, the immobilized consortium at a 2:1 (MO2-4:TL01-2) inoculum volume ratio showed the best crude oil removal capacity. The immobilized consortium removed 77% of 2000 mg L-1 crude oil in seawater over 7 days. The immobilized consortium maintained crude oil removal efficacy in semicontinuous experiments. In addition, the immobilized consortium was used to remediate seawater contaminated with 1000 mg L-1 crude oil in a 20 L wave tank. After 28 days, the crude oil degradation efficiency of immobilized consortium was approximately 70%, and crude oil degradation through natural attenuation was not observed. Moreover, the genomic features of strains MO2-4 and TL01-2 are reported. Genomic analyses of both strains confirmed the presence of many genes involved in hydrocarbon degradation, heavy metal resistance, biosurfactant synthesis, and biofilm formation, supporting the biodegradation results and characterizing strain properties. The results of this work introduce the potential benefit of simultaneous immobilization of bacterial consortia to improve efficiency of crude oil biodegradation and has motivated further investigations into large-scale remediation of crude oil-contaminated seawater.']"

No definitive treatment is currently available. Prenatal and newborn screening have the potential to improve clinical outcome of patients affected with POLG-related disorders. We reported a 4-month-old infant who presented with developmental delay, fever, and diarrhea. Within two weeks after hospital admission, the patient developed hepatic failure and died. Liver necropsy demonstrated an extensive loss of hepatocytes and bile duct proliferations. Trio-whole exome sequencing identified that the patient was compound heterozygous for a novel frameshift variant c.3102delG (p.Lys1035Serfs*59) and a common variant c.3286C>T (p.Arg1096Cys) in POLG (NM_002693.3) inherited from the mother and father, respectively.

The properties of levan and LFOs depend on their chain lengths, thereby determining their potential applications in food and pharmaceutical industries such as prebiotics and anti-tumor agents. Therefore, an ability to redesign and engineer the active site of levansucrase for synthesis of products with desired degree of polymerization (DP) is very beneficial. We employed computational protein design, docking and molecular dynamics to redesign and engineer the active site of Bacillus licheniformis RN-01 levansucrase for production of LFOs with DP up to five (GF4), using two approaches: 1) blocking oligosaccharide binding track of GF3-LS complex with large aromatic residues and 2) eliminating hydrogen bond interactions between terminal glucose of GF4 and side chains of binding residues of GF4-LS complex. The designed enzymes and their product patterns from these two approaches were experimentally characterized.

Previous study found that Y246S mutant of Bacillus licheniformis RN-01 levansucrase (oligosaccharide producing levansucrase, OPL) could effectively produce LFOs but its thermostability is limited at high temperature. In this study, molecular dynamics (MD) and computational protein design were used to create mutants with higher thermostability than OPL by rigidifying highly flexible residues on enzyme surface. MD results show that highly flexible residues suitable for design are K82, N83, D179, and Q308. Two approaches were employed to improve their interactions by allowing them to be amino acids that could potentially form favorable interactions with their neighboring residues or natural amino acids except G, P and C. Flexibilities of designed residues of K82H, N83R, Q308S and K82H/N83R mutants are lower than those of OPL. Experimental results show that characteristics and product patterns of designed mutants are relatively similar to those of OPL. K82H/N83R mutant has higher thermostability than OPL with 1.7-fold increase in t1/2. Circular dichroism result suggests that designed mutations do not drastically affect secondary structures.

Sequences for levansucrase from Bacillus amyloliquefaciens KK9 and inulosucrase from Lactobacillus reuteri 121 were fused genetically with a flexible eighteen residue glycine-serine peptide linker. SDS-PAGE analysis showed that the molecular weight of obtained fusion protein is approximately of 120 kDa, corresponding to the expected fusion protein molecular weight. Kinetic analysis revealed that after protein combination, the kinetic parameters of both enzymes are slightly changed. Biochemical characterization revealed that fusion did not affect the optimum pH and temperature for catalysis, but significantly change the stability of the enzyme.

CPV-2c has also been reported in Asia, including cases in China, India, Taiwan and Vietnam. However, CPV-2c has never been reported in Thailand. In this study, we conducted viral enteric disease surveillance in dogs and cats in Thailand during 2016–2018. During 20 months of surveillance, 507 rectal swab samples were collected from dogs (n = 444) and cats (n = 63) with and without clinical signs.

In addition, eight selected full genome sequences of Vietnamese canine circovirus were analyzed and used for phylogeny. Results: In total 19.8% of samples were found to be positive for canine circovirus. Phylogeny revealed that the Vietnamese canine circovirus strains were clustered in two different genotypes (genotype-1 and -3). The genetic diversity among Vietnamese canine circovirus was 86.0–87.2%. The nucleotide discrepancy among both genotypes altered the deduced amino acid sequence in 14 and ten residues of the replicase and capsid proteins, respectively. Genetic recombination analysis revealed that the Vietnamese canine circovirus-6 strain has the American and Chinese canine circovirus as its major and minor parents, respectively. Only a single dog revealed triple detections of CPV-2c, Canine circovirus and canine adenovirus (1.2%). Conclusion: The co-circulation of two different genotypes of canine circovirus and CPV-2c in dogs in Vietnam has been illustrated. Clinical relevance: The mortality rate with CPV-2 only (22%) doubled in dogs with canine circovirus and CPV-2 co-infection.', 'Phylogenetic evidence of a novel lineage of canine pneumovirus and a naturally recombinant strain isolated from dogs with respiratory illness in Thailand  2019 The Author(s).Background: Canine pneumovirus (CPV) is a pathogen that causes respiratory disease in dogs, and recent outbreaks in shelters in America and Europe have been reported. However, based on published data and documents, the identification of CPV and its variant in clinically symptomatic individual dogs in Thailand through Asia is limited. Therefore, the aims of this study were to determine the emergence of CPV and to consequently establish the genetic characterization and phylogenetic analysis of the CPV strains from 209 dogs showing respiratory distress in Thailand. Results: This study identified and described the full-length CPV genome from three strains, designated herein as CPV_CP13 TH/2015, CPV_CP82 TH/2016 and CPV_SR1 TH/2016, that were isolated from six dogs out of 209 dogs (2.9%) with respiratory illness in Thailand. Phylogenetic analysis suggested that these three Thai CPV strains (CPV TH strains) belong to the CPV subgroup A and form a novel lineage; proposed as the Asian prototype. Specific mutations in the deduced amino acids of these CPV TH strains were found in the G/glycoprotein sequence, suggesting potential substitution sites for subtype classification. Results of intragenic recombination analysis revealed that CPV_CP82 TH/2016 is a recombinant strain, where the recombination event occurred in the L gene with the Italian prototype CPV Bari/100-12 as the putative major parent. Selective pressure analysis demonstrated that the majority of the nucleotides in the G/glycoprotein were under purifying selection with evidence of positive selection sites. Conclusions: This collective information on the CPV TH strains is the first evidence of CPV emergence with genetic characterization in Thailand and as first report in Asia, where homologous recombination acts as a potential force driving the genetic diversity and shaping the evolution of canine pneumovirus.']"

Recently, several studies have revealed that pathogenic bacteria could be found in cattle lice, and it can act as a potential vector for transmitting louse-borne diseases. However, the cattle lice and their pathogenic bacteria in Thailand have never been evaluated. In the present study, we aim to determine the presence of bacterial pathogens in cattle lice collected from three localities of Thailand. Total genomic DNA was extracted from 109 cattle louse samples and the Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) of 18S rRNA was developed to identify the cattle louse. Moreover, PCR was used for screening Bartonella spp., Acinetobacter spp., and Rickettsia spp. in cattle louse samples. The positive PCR products were cloned and sequenced. The phylogenetic tree based on the partial 18S rRNA sequences demonstrated that cattle lice species in this study are classified into two groups according to reference sequences; Haematopinus quadripertusus and Haematopinus spp. closely related to H. tuberculatus. The pathogen detection revealed that Bartonella spp. DNA of gltA and rpoB were detected in 25 of 109 samples (22.93%) both egg and adult stages, whereas Acinetobacter spp. and Rickettsia spp. were not detected in all cattle lice DNA samples. The gltA and rpoB sequences showed that the Bartonella spp. DNA was found in both H. quadripertusus and Haematopinus spp. closely related to H. tuberculatus. This study is the first report of the Bartonella spp. detected in cattle lice from Thailand. The finding obtained from this study could be used to determine whether the cattle lice can serve as a potential vector to transmit these pathogenic bacteria among cattle and may affect animal to human health.', 'Risk factors of Bartonella spp. infection and the association between Bartonella spp. and T-lymphocyte subset alteration in asymptomatic retrovirus-infected cats in Bangkok Metropolitan, Thailand  2022 Veterinary World. All rights reserved.Background and Aim: Cats are a reservoir for Bartonella spp. infection in humans. Human bartonellosis causes disseminated inflammation to develop in immunocompromised patients, such as those infected with human immunodeficiency virus. However, the associated risks of Bartonella spp. infection in immunocompromised retroviral-infected cats have been inconclusive. This study aimed to evaluate the associated risks of Bartonella spp. infection with the alteration of T-lymphocyte subsets of retroviral-infected cats. Materials and Methods: We collected blood samples from 161 client-owned cats at veterinary clinics and hospitals throughout the Bangkok Metropolitan area from 2017 to 2020. The samples underwent hematological biochemical tests, feline retroviral status evaluation, Bartonella spp. polymerase chain reaction assay, immunofluorescence assay, and CD4+ and CD8+ lymphocyte counts. Risk factors associated with Bartonella spp. infection were determined by odds ratio (OR). Hematological and biochemical parameters were compared using independent t-tests. CD4+ and CD8+ lymphocyte counts and the CD4+/CD8+ ratio were compared among groups classified according to their retroviral and Bartonella spp. infection status. Results: The prevalence of Bartonella spp. in our study cohort was 16.1%, and the seroprevalence was 94.9%. Cats aged >1 year were at a higher risk of seropositivity than cats aged <1 year (OR: 4.296, 95% confidence interval: 1.010-18.275). The CD8+ percentage was significantly higher in seropositive cats (p = 0.026). There was a significant reduction in the CD4+/CD8+ ratio between cats negative for both retrovirus and Bartonella spp. infection and cats with concurrent retrovirus and Bartonella spp. infection (p = 0.041). Conclusion: In endemic countries or areas, cat owners must be made aware of the risk of exposure to Bartonella spp. due to the high rate of bacteremia and seroprevalence. Retrovirus-infected cats with concurrent Bartonella spp. infection also showed a significant, inverted CD4+/CD8+ ratio, which may be used as a novel marker in bartonellosis. Similar studies focusing on the different stages of retrovirus infection should be undertaken further to elucidate the effect of retrovirus infection on Bartonella spp. infection.', 'Molecular analysis of canine filaria and its wolbachia endosymbionts in domestic dogs collected from two animal university hospitals in Bangkok metropolitan region, Thailand  2019 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.Canine filariasis is caused by several nematode species, such as Dirofilaria immitis, Dirofilaria repens, Brugia pahangi, Brugia malayi, and Acanthocheilonema reconditum. Zoonotic filariasis is one of the world’s neglected tropical diseases. Since 2000, the World Health Organization (WHO) has promoted a global filarial eradication program to eliminate filariasis by 2020. Apart from vector control strategies, the infection control of reservoir hosts is necessary for more effective filariasis control. In addition, many studies have reported that Wolbachia is necessary for the development, reproduction, and survival of the filarial nematode. Consequently, the use of antibiotics to kill Wolbachia in nematodes has now become an alternative strategy to control filariasis. Previously, a case of subconjunctival dirofilariasis caused by Dirofilaria spp. has been reported in a woman who resides in the center of Bangkok, Thailand. Therefore, our study aimed to principally demonstrate the presence of filarial nematodes and Wolbachia bacteria in blood collected from domestic dogs from the Bangkok Metropolitan Region, Thailand. A total of 57 blood samples from dogs with suspected dirofilariasis who had visited veterinary clinics in Bangkok were collected. The investigations for the presence of microfilaria were carried out by using both microscopic and molecular examinations. PCR was used as the molecular detection method for the filarial nematodes based on the COI and ITS1 regions. The demonstration of Wolbachia was performed using PCR to amplify the FtsZ gene. All positive samples by PCR were then cloned and sequenced. The results showed that the filarial nematodes were detected in 16 samples (28.07%) using microscopic examinations. The molecular detection of filarial species using COI-PCR revealed that 50 samples (87.72%) were positive; these consisted of 33 (57.89%), 13 (22.81%), and 4 (7.02%) samples for D. immitis, B. pahangi, and B. malayi, respectively. While the ITS1-PCR showed that 41 samples (71.93%) were positive—30 samples (52.63%) were identified as containing D. immitis and 11 samples (19.30%) were identified to have B. pahangi, whereas B. malayi was not detected. Forty-seven samples (82.45%) were positive for Wolbachia DNA and the phylogenetic tree of all positive Wolbachia was classified into the supergroup C clade. This study has established fundamental data on filariasis associated with Wolbachia infection in domestic dogs in the Bangkok Metropolitan Region. An extensive survey of dog blood samples would provide valuable epidemiologic data on potential zoonotic filariasis in Thailand. In addition, this information could be used for the future development of more effective prevention and control strategies for canine filariasis in Thailand.']"

All rights reserved. No commercial use is permitted unless otherwise expressly granted. Background Polymorphisms in human leucocyte antigen (HLA) class I genes have been found to be associated with cold medicine (CM)-related Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) with severe ocular complications (SOC). Because ethnic differences in genetic predisposition to SJS/TEN among different populations have been proposed, we focused on Thai patients and investigated the association between HLA class I genotypes and CM-SJS/TEN with SOC. Methods This multicentre case-control study was conducted between September 2014 and August 2017. Seventy-one Thai patients with SJS/TEN with SOC and 159 healthy Thai controls were enrolled. HLA typing was performed. Genetic relationships were analysed using Fisher's exact test. Results Of 71 patients with SJS/TEN with SOC (28 male, 43 female), 49 (69%) had a history of taking cold medications prior to SJS/TEN onset. The mean age of onset was 26.7±17.1 years (range, 2-77 years). HLA-B ∗ 44:03 (OR, 7.2, p=5.5×10 -6, pc=1.1×10 -4) and HLA-C ∗ 07:01 (OR, 6.1, p=7.1×10 -6, pc=1.1×10 -4) showed significant positive associations with Thai patients with CM-SJS/TEN with SOC. Additionally, 17 of 49 patients with CM-SJS/TEN with SOC (34.7%) significantly harboured the HLA-B ∗ 44:03 and HLA-C ∗ 07:01 haplotype compared with only 11 of 159 healthy controls (6.9%) (OR=7.1, p=5.5×10 -6). Conclusions HLA-B ∗ 44:03-HLA-C ∗ 07:01 haplotype is a potential risk factor for CM-SJS/TEN with SOC in the Thai population. This study supports that HLA-B ∗ 44:03 might be a common marker for CM-SJS/TEN with SOC in Eurasia populations, including European, Indian, Japanese and Thai."", 'A comprehensive review of hla and severe cutaneous adverse drug reactions: Implication for clinical pharmacogenomics and precision medicine  2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) encoded by the HLA gene is an important modulator for immune responses and drug hypersensitivity reactions as well. Genetic polymorphisms of HLA vary widely at population level and are responsible for developing severe cutaneous adverse drug reactions (SCARs) such as Stevens–Johnson syndrome (SJS), toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), maculopapular exanthema (MPE). The associations of different HLA alleles with the risk of drug induced SJS/TEN, DRESS and MPE are strongly supportive for clinical considerations. Prescribing guidelines generated by different national and international working groups for translation of HLA pharmacogenetics into clinical practice are underway and functional in many countries, including Thailand. Cutting edge genomic technologies may accelerate wider adoption of HLA screening in routine clinical settings. There are great opportunities and several challenges as well for effective implementation of HLA genotyping globally in routine clinical practice for the prevention of drug induced SCARs substantially, enforcing precision medicine initiatives.']"

Objectives: To explore the main chemical components of the root extracts and investigate their in-vitro α-glucosidase inhibitory activity. Materials & Methods: The dried root powders were macerated with an increasing polarity of solvents (hexane, dichloromethane, ethyl acetate and ethanol). The levels were evaluated of the inhibition of α-glucosidase by all root extracts. The main chemical components of the bioactive extracts were investigated using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS); molecular docking of four promising GC-MS-detected compounds was conducted. Results: All the phytochemical assays of the root extracts confirmed the presence of bioactive secondary metabolites such as terpenes, steroids, phenolics and flavonoids. Among the four crude extracts, the dichloromethane root extract had the highest α-glucosidase inhibitory activity against rat intestinal sucrase with a half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) value of 0.943 mg/mL. Furthermore, this extract inhibited yeast α-glucosidase with an IC50 value of 0.646 mg/mL, having greater activity than the standard drug, Acarbose® (IC50 = 1.122 mg/mL). Additionally, analysis of the main chemical components of the dichloromethane extract based on GC-MS revealed the presence of Neophytadiene as a promising bioactive component. Molecular docking of the four promising GC-MS-detected compounds suggested the feasibility of these compounds as viable α-glucosidase inhibitors. Main finding: This study is the first to demonstrate the presence of an antidiabetic diterpene in the plant using GC-MS analysis. Therefore, this plant has high potential for further research into antidiabetic medical applications.""]"

All rights reserved.Change orders are inevitable in most construction projects. The conventional change order practice is usually associated with 2D drawings and various paper-based documents, which cannot illustrate the existing and altered building conditions efficiently. This often leads to misinterpretation and miscommunication among project participants. In addition, cost and schedule information, which is basic inputs for analyzing the impact of change orders, is usually scattered and poorly organized resulting in difficulties in retrieving it. The evaluation of cost and schedule impacts is often subjective and unsystematic contributing to construction disputes. Building information modeling (BIM) is widely used in modern construction projects. BIM is a promising construction information management tool, which can address the aforementioned challenges. In this paper, we develop the BIM-Integrated System for Evaluating the Impacts of Construction Change Orders (BIM-ISICO), which can systematically analyze three main impacts of a change order: Physical conditions, schedule, and cost. The BIM-ISICO assists users in observing and visualizing the effect of a change order on building conditions systematically via 3D BIM models. The system can also evaluate the impacts of such change order on project cost and schedule. It establishes a new paradigm of delay and cost analysis by minimizing subjectivity and providing the auditing trails of change orders. To demonstrate its efficacy and practicality, the system is applied to an actual 18-story building project for analyzing the impact of a construction change order.

All rights reserved.In this paper, the authors have designed and implemented the prototype for a near real-time wireless image sequence streaming cloud with two-layered restoration for a road traffic monitoring application of a small-scale network. Since the proposed design is targeted to implement outdoors where the link or node failure could occur, the fault-tolerant capability must be considered. Having only one layer restoration may not provide a good quality of service. Therefore, a two-layer restoration framework is designed in the proposed system by restoring the network layer with the underlying software-defined wireless mesh network capability and at the local broker selection over the Apache Kafka framework. The monitoring application performance has been investigated for the end-to-end average latency and image loss percentage by outdoor testing for 13 hours from 5:40 P.M. 17th November 2020 to 6:40 A.M. 18th November 2020. The end-to-end average latency and image loss percentage have been found to be within the acceptable condition i.e. less than 5 seconds on average with approximated 10% image losses. The proposed system has also been compared with the traditional ad-hoc network, running the OLSR-based network layer, in terms of the rerouting time, restoration time and end-to-end average latency. Based on the emulated wireless network in controllable laboratory environments, the proposed SDWMN-based system outperforms the conventional OLSR-based system with potentially faster rerouting/restoration time due to SDN central controllability and with only marginally increased end-to-end average latency after re-routing/restoration completion.

Together with software-defined networking, WMN can be programmed and adapted to dynamic wireless environments. Software-defined wireless mesh network (SDWMN) gets therefore increasing attentions in networking research as well as network-centric application communities. In this paper, SDWMN has been designed as the main underlying platform that allows sensor nodes installed on the road to relay their sensed data. Particularly, this research is concerned with the development of vehicular traffic monitoring technique that can sense the presence of vehicles passing by the SDWMN sensor nodes. Since the penetration of vehicles equipped with WIFI devices is significantly increased, a WIFI packet measurement application has been developed for each SDWMN node to detect the service set identifier (SSID) of the wireless communication for monitoring the vehicle traffic. Each traveling vehicle that provides SSID can be sensed by each SDWMN node along with the corresponding time stamp. A functionality has then been developed to map the raw sensor data to obtain the travel time of vehicles. This technique has been developed on a real SDWMN system testbed and its functionality is tested on Phayathai road in Bangkok, Thailand. The obtained experimental results suggest the practicality of this vehicular traffic monitoring technique with up to 5,000 data records obtainable per sensor node per day. With continuously growing number of WIFI-equipped vehicles, it is believed that the proposed technique can be used cost-effectively to provide real-time vehicular traffic conditions in the future without cost burdens from other conventional vehicular traffic sensors requiring highly costed communication infrastructures.']"

Thus, this study aimed to investigate and compare oral and fecal mycobiome between wild and captive macaques by using high-throughput sequencing on internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2) rDNA. The results showed that the mycobiome of wild macaque has greater alpha diversity. The fecal mycobiome has more limited alpha diversity than those in oral cavity. The community is mainly dominated by saprophytic yeast in Kasachstania genus which is related to aiding metabolic function in gut.

Serving not only as a useful homologue of the disease-linked ABO system in humans, macaque ABO blood groups must be typed in colonies prior to performing experimental procedures requiring blood transfusion or transplantation. While the rates of blood type incompatibility and the distributions of A, B and AB blood groups are known in large samples of rhesus (Macaca mulatta) and cynomolgus (M. fascicularis) macaques, there is a dearth of blood type data from macaque populations occupying the rhesus-cynomolgus hybrid zone in Southeast Asia. Using molecular phenotyping, we profiled ABO blood group distributions of 232 macaques from 10 populations in the hybrid zone and compared them to pure blood populations of the two species. We found that while these distributions are significantly different in most populations, there was a lack of differentiation between the hybrid and cynomolgus macaques as well as between the Thai and neighbouring populations. This supports a more expansive model of hybridization between rhesus and cynomolgus macaques than often proposed and highlights the increased need for consideration of population genetic structure in biomedical studies that employ macaques as animal models. Additionally, we report an enrichment of indeterminate blood types in the hybrid populations.', 'Comparative analysis of oral-gut microbiota between captive and wild long-tailed macaque in Thailand  2021, The Author(s).Long-tailed macaques (Macaca fascicularis), distributed in Southeast Asia, are generally used in biomedical research. At present, the expansion of human communities overlapping of macaques’ natural habitat causes human-macaque conflicts. To mitigate this problem in Thailand, the National Primate Research Center of Thailand, Chulalongkorn University (NPRCT-CU), was granted the permit to catch the surplus wild-born macaques and transfer them to the center. Based on the fact that the diets provided and the captive environments were different, their oral-gut microbiota should be altered. Thus, we investigated and compared the oral and fecal microbiome between wild-born macaques that lived in the natural habitats and those transferred to and reared in the NPRCT-CU for 1 year. The results from 16S rRNA high-throughput sequencing showed that the captive macaques had distinct oral-gut microbiota profiles and lower bacterial richness compared to those in wild macaques. The gut of wild macaques was dominated by Firmicutes which is probably associated with lipid absorption and storage.

High accuracy traffic prediction has been studied in large-scale networks. Deep learning methods are able to analyze the complex, multi-dimensional data to provide the least traffic prediction error. Both spatial and temporal dependencies provide significant implications for traffic prediction. Hence, we propose a combination of deep learning method architectures which consist of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) to analyze spatial and temporal features and predict traffic speed in multiple steps. An accident has a major impact on local traffic congestion. We employ an autoencoder with a monotonic attention mechanism to learn accident embedding input to detect unexpected accidents and their effects. An experiment was conducted on two datasets of Highways England and Thai Expressways. Results showed that spatial and temporal features can solve problems at different locations in the traffic network using the deep learning method to improve traffic prediction performance. Furthermore, a monotonic attention mechanism using an autoencoder to learn how accidents impact on traffic congestion can minimize the prediction error.', 'Bottleneck based gridlock prediction in an urban road network using long short-term memory  2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.The traffic bottlenecks in urban road networks are more challenging to investigate and discover than in freeways or simple arterial networks. A bottleneck indicates the congestion evolution and queue formation, which consequently disturb travel delay and degrade the urban traffic environment and safety. For urban road networks, sensors are needed to cover a wide range of areas, especially for bottleneck and gridlock analysis, requiring high installation and maintenance costs. The emerging widespread availability of GPS vehicles significantly helps to overcome the geographic coverage and spacing limitations of traditional fixed-location detector data. Therefore, this study investigated GPS vehicles that have passed through the links in the simulated gridlock-looped intersection area. The sample size estimation is fundamental to any traffic engineering analysis. Therefore, this study tried a different number of sample sizes to analyze the severe congestion state of gridlock. Traffic condition prediction is one of the primary components of intelligent transportation systems. In this study, the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network was applied to predict gridlock based on bottleneck states of intersections in the simulated urban road network. This study chose to work on the Chula-Sathorn SUMO Simulator (Chula-SSS) dataset. It was calibrated with the past actual traffic data collection by using the Simulation of Urban MObility (SUMO) software. The experiments show that LSTM provides satisfactory results for gridlock prediction with temporal dependencies. The reported prediction error is based on long-range time dependencies on the respective sample sizes using the calibrated Chula-SSS dataset. On the other hand, the low sampling rate of GPS trajectories gives high RMSE and MAE error, but with reduced computation time. Analyzing the percentage of simulated GPS data with different random seed numbers suggests the possibility of gridlock identification and reports satisfying prediction errors.', 'Vehicle rollover detection in tripped and untripped rollovers using recurrent neural networks  2020 ASTES Publishers. All rights reserved.Comparing to other types of vehicle accidents, fatality rate of tipped rollover accidents shows significant number. Thus, tripped rollover prevention systems are important in order to keep driver safe. In other hands, different rollover indices are defined to handle the risk. The variable unknown parameters of each index, for instance, current load of the vehicle or center of gravity, are considered as a difficulty. In this work, the recurrent neural networks, which are designed to work on sequential data in order to provide data estimation without additional estimation algorithm, are investigated in purpose to estimate the tripped and untripped rollover index. The vehicle simulation software with industrial standard CarSim is applied to validate the result. The Tanh recurrent neural network is stated in the result to be the most accurate tripped rollover index estimator for the uncertain parameters, for example, sprung mass and the height of the center of gravity. The suitable input features for tripped and untripped rollover index and neural network structure are verified. To prevent and provide warning of rollover, an advance future prediction can also be designed for the future tripped and untripped rollover prediction.']"

The de Rham, Gabadadze, and Tolly (dRGT) massive gravity is one of the gravity theories that modified general relativity. In this paper, we investigate the greybody factor from the massive scalar field in both the asymptotically dS and the AdS spacetime using the WKB and the rigorous bound methods. We found that the greybody factor depends on the shape of the potential as found in quantum mechanics. The higher the potential barrier, the lower the amount of the greybody factor. Interestingly, for the low multipole case, we found that there exists a critical mass which provides the maximum bound of the greybody factor. This is a crucial feature of the massive scalar field on the greybody factor from the black holes in both the asymptotically dS and the AdS spacetime.', 'Greybody factor for black string in dRGT massive gravity  2019, The Author(s).The greybody factor from the black string in the de Rham–Gabadadze–Tolley (dRGT) massive gravity theory is investigated in this study. The dRGT massive gravity theory is one of the modified gravity theories used in explaining the current acceleration in the expansion of the universe. Through the use of cylindrical symmetry, black strings in dRGT massive gravity are shown to exist. When quantum effects are taken into account, black strings can emit thermal radiation, called Hawking radiation. The Hawking radiation at spatial infinity differs from that at the source by the so-called greybody factor. In this paper, we examine the rigorous bounds on the greybody factors from the dRGT black strings. The results show that the greybody factor crucially depends on the shape of the potential, which is characterised by the model parameters. The results agree with ones in quantum mechanics; the higher the potential, the harder it is for the waves to penetrate, and also the lower the bound for the rigorous bounds.', 'Near-horizon quasinormal modes of charged scalar around a general spherically symmetric black hole  2019 authors. Published by the American Physical Society.We study the quasinormal modes (QNMs) of a charged scalar in the static spherically symmetric black hole background near the event and cosmological horizon. Starting with numerical analysis of the QNMs of black hole in the dRGT massive gravity, the mathematical tool called the asymptotic iteration method (AIM) is used to calculate the quasinormal frequencies. The parameters such as the mass and charge of the black hole, the cosmological constant, the coefficient of the linear term from massive gravity γ, and the mass of the scalar are varied to study the behavior of the QNMs. We found the tower pattern of the near-horizon quasinormal frequencies from the numerical results by AIM where the real parts depend only on product of the charge of the black hole and the scalar field and the imaginary parts depend only on the surface gravity. To confirm the numerical finding, we analytically determine the exact QNMs of the charged scalar near the horizons of any static spherically symmetric black hole background in the simple universal forms; ω=qQrh+iκhn and ω=qQrc+i|κc|n where n is a nonpositive integer and κh,c is the surface gravity, for the event and cosmological horizon respectively. Extending our analysis, we also compute the four towers of the near-horizon QNMs that can reach the far region. The four kinds of QNMs converge to certain asymptotic values with equally spacing imaginary parts and the real parts proportional to qQ/rh,c. These modes do not match with the all-region (WKB) modes of the real background since they originate from the linearly approximated metric.']"

The last section of the review will emphasize the major challenges regarding the broad application of lignin as reinforcing filler in rubber industry. This study will be the part of huge interest of modern rubber researchers concerning the utilization of lignin for the development of non-petroleum based renewable and sustainable rubber composites.', 'Recent advances of natural fibers based green rubber composites: Properties, current status, and future perspectives  2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.The searching of suitable alternatives to petroleum-based fillers is an uncompromising challenge in present day rubber research.

This study explored the dispersion and reinforcement performance of binary fillers in natural rubber. Graphite powder was used as a solid lubricating silica filler in the rubber matrix, and shear force was applied using a conventional two-roll mixing mill. The curing, mechanical, and morphological properties were studied to evaluate the mechanism of binary filler dispersion in the rubber matrix. Binary fillers comprising silica and graphite offered better mutual dispersion, which was observed by scanning electron microscopy and mechanical testing and confirmed by atomic force microscopy. Better filler dispersion in natural rubber improved the mechanical and age resistance properties. The modulus at 100% strain and stress at break of unfilled rubber were increased by nearly 110% and 15%, respectively, when 20 phr (per hundred gram of rubber) of binary filler in a 1:1 weight ratio was used, and the composite exhibited better aging resistance and mechanical properties, compared to those of composites with single-filler systems, which may be attributable to the excellent filler dispersion in the rubber matrix.']"

The main sources of CO2 is from power plants in the form of flue gas. Recently, the effective technology to capture CO2 is chemical absorption by using aqueous amine solutions. The commonly used amine solution is monoethanolamine (MEA). It has disadvantages like low capacity and high energy consumption. 2-methylaminoethanol (2-MAE) as a new solvent has been formulated to improve the performance of CO2 mitigation but the cost of this chemical is higher. The two amines are mixed together to obtain higher performance and to compensate the drawbacks of each solvents. The objective of this research is to measure the solubility of CO2 in a mixed solvent with 20: 10 wt% of MEA and 2-MAE for CO2 capture from the flue gas stream at the temperature of 313.15 K and 353.15 K and CO2 partial pressures ranging from 5 to 100 kPa. The experimental results are compared with that of single solution of MEA and 2-MAE at the same conditions. From the results, it is reported that in term of cyclic capacity, the amine mixture provides a better performance, which is higher than that of MEA ranging from 2.35 % to 61.90 % but lower than that of 2-MAE from 8.76 % to 43.45 %. The rate of CO2 loading of mixed solution is relatively close to that of MEA but lower than that of 2-MAE. Therefore, in the future, the mixed solvent may be used as an alternative solution for CO2 capture instead of using single amine.', 'Comparative mass transfer performance of CO2 absorption using highly-concentrated AMP-PZ-MEA ternary amines solvent  2023 The Author(s)Mass transfer performance of CO2 absorption is based on selecting an effective amine solvent, hence, an examination of the overall mass transfer coefficient (KGav) and CO2 removal efficiency, is significant for obtaining the most favorable CO2 capture performance. This study compared KGav and CO2 removal efficiency of the highly concentrated ternary amines solvent at various concentrations with the benchmark monoethanolamine (MEA) in a laboratory scale CO2 absorption packed-column. The six blends of 2-amino-2-methyl-1-propanol (AMP), piperazine (PZ), and MEA are formulated as ternary solvents at high PZ/AMP molar ratio (1.25–3.75) and total amine concentration (6M and 7M). Be noted that the solvent precipitation was not observed in this study. The absorption experiment was operated at 303 K temperature, 12% CO2 by volume, and CO2 loading of 0.25 mol CO2/mol amine. The experimental results showed that KGav and CO2 removal efficiency for AMP-PZ-MEA and MEA solvents increased as total amine concentration increased. Also, KGav and CO2 removal efficiency of the PZ-AMP-MEA solvent are greater than those of 5M MEA. An increase of PZ/AMP molar ratio had a positive influence on the absorption performance for ternary amines. In comparison with the benchmark 5M MEA, all the studied AMP-PZ-MEA solvents showed an outperformance. The two suggested formulae, which are 0.95:3.55:1.5 (6M) and 0.95:3.55:2.5 (7M), possessed approximately 1.5 and 2.5 times higher KGav and 17.34% and 17.63% greater CO2 removal efficiency compared with the benchmark 5M MEA.', 'Comprehensive mass transfer analysis of CO2 absorption in high potential ternary AMP-PZ-MEA solvent using three-level factorial design  2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.Mass transfer of CO2 absorption in 2-amino-2-methyl-1-propanol (AMP) - piperazine (PZ) - monoethanolamine (MEA) was statistically investigated in terms of overall mass transfer coefficient (KGav) and CO2 removal percentage. The parameters of interest were lean solvent flux (A), rich gas flux (B), CO2 loading in the lean solvent (C), and ratio of the sampling height to the total column height h/ h (D). From ANOVA, A was the most impactable parameter on both responses with three-quarters of the overall contribution. Regarding the three-level factorial design, a second-order polynomial increasing trend of KGav was observed as C and/or D increased. Additionally, KGav linearly increased as A increased but was not affected by B. On the other hand, the CO2 removal percentage linearly increased as A and/or D increased but linearly decreased as B and/or C increased. Surface analysis suggested the optimum condition for both responses at a high level of A, low level of B, low level of C, and middle level of D. In this work, D was statistically investigated and included in the predictive correlation for KGav for the first time. The main advantage of the proposed correlation over the recently reported correlations was that it did not require a measurement of CO2 partial pressure along the column height. For each amine component in the blend, (i) AMP played a positive key role in cyclic capacity and solvent regeneration duty, (ii) PZ enhanced transfer rate, and (iii) MEA elevated total amine concentration. As a result, 1.5:1.5:3 was recommended due to (i) elevations of 68.2% KGav, 14% CO2 removal percentage, 15.1% absorption capacity, and 66.7% cyclic capacity and (ii) reduction of 50% regeneration duty compared with 5 M MEA. With respect to the other literature-reported solvents, AMP-PZ-MEA is very competitive in terms of transfer coefficient, cyclic capacity, and solvent regeneration heat duty.

The very high productivity of CH4 with the very low H2 productivity resulted from the recycled methanogen sludge from the third bioreactor to the first and second bioreactors.

Interestingly, the three-stage anaerobic sequencing batch reactor system gave a much higher energy production rate and a higher optimum chemical oxygen demand loading rate than previously reported anaerobic systems since it was able to maintain very high microbial concentrations in all bioreactors with very high values of both alkalinity and solution pH, especially in the third bioreactor, resulting in sufficient levels of micronutrients for anaerobic digestion.']"

Three primary teeth (called “OIDI teeth”) obtained from 3 unrelated COL1A2 patients were investigated and compared with 9 control teeth from age-matched healthy individuals using colorimetry, micro–computed tomography, Knoop microhardness, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and histology. Results: All patients were identified with heterozygous glycine substitutions in COL1A2. The COL1A2 mutations, c.1531G>T and c.2027G>T, were de novo, whereas c.3106G>C was inherited. OIDI1, 2, and 3 teeth had a substantial decrease in dentin microhardness and lightness. OIDI2 enamel microhardness was significantly reduced, whereas OIDI1 and 3 had enamel microhardness comparable to that of control individuals.

Imposing a linear superpotential allows to satisfy easily the slow-roll conditions, avoiding the so-called η-problem, and leads to an interesting class of small field inflation models, characterised by an inflationary plateau around the maximum of the scalar potential near the origin, where R-symmetry is restored with the inflaton rolling down to a minimum describing the present phase of the Universe. Inflation can be driven by either an F- or a D-term, while the minimum has a positive tuneable vacuum energy. The models agree with cosmological observations and in the simplest case predict a rather small tensor-to-scalar ratio of primordial perturbations. We propose a generalisation of Fayet-Iliopoulos model as a microscopic model leading to this class of inflation models at low energy.

It contains a chiral multiplet charged under a gauged R-symmetry which is restored at the maximum of the scalar potential with a plateau where inflation takes place. The effective field theory relies on two phenomenological parameters corresponding to corrections to the Kähler potential up to second order around the origin. The first guarantees the maximum at the origin and the second allows the tuning of the vacuum energy between the F- and D-term contributions. Here, we provide a microscopic model leading to the required effective theory. It is a Fayet–Iliopoulos model with two charged chiral multiplets under a second U (1) R-symmetry coupled to supergravity. In the Brout–Englert–Higgs phase of this U (1) , the gauge field becomes massive and can be integrated out in the limit of small supersymmetry breaking scale. In this work, we perform this integration and we show that there is a region of parameter space where the effective supergravity realises our proposal of small field inflation from supersymmetry breaking consistently with observations and with a minimum of tuneable energy that can describe the present phase of our Universe.', 'Challenges in supersymmetric cosmology  2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.We discuss the possibility that inflation is driven by supersymmetry breaking with the scalar component of the goldstino superfield (sgoldstino) playing the role of the inflaton and charged under a gauged U(1) R-symmetry. Imposing a linear superpotential allows us to satisfy easily the slow-roll conditions, avoiding the so-called η-problem, and leads to an interesting class of small field inflation models, characterised by an inflationary plateau around the maximum of the scalar potential near the origin, where R-symmetry is restored with the inflaton rolling down to a minimum describing the present phase of the Universe. Inflation can be driven by either an F-or a D-term, while the minimum has a positive tuneable vacuum energy. The models agree with cosmological observations and in the simplest case predict a rather small tensor-to-scalar ratio of primordial perturbations. We propose a generalisation of Fayet-Iliopoulos model as a microscopic model leading to this class of inflation models at low energy.']"

All Rights Reserved.Human pythiosis is a life-threatening human disease caused by Pythium insidiosum. In Thailand, vascular pythiosis is the most common form and carries a mortality rate of 10 to 40%, despite aggressive treatment with radical surgery, antifungal agents, and immunotherapy. Itraconazole and terbinafine have been the mainstay of treatment, until recently, based on case report data showing potential synergistic effects against Brazilian P. insidiosum isolates. However, the synergistic effects of itraconazole and terbinafine against Thai P. insidiosum isolates were not observed. This study tested the in vitro susceptibilities of 27 Thai human P. insidiosum isolates (clade II, n = 17; clade IV, n = 10), 12 Thai environmental P. insidiosum isolates (clade II, n = 4; clade IV, n = 8), and 11 non-Thai animal P. insidiosum isolates (clade I, n = 9; clade II, n = 2) to antibiotics in eight antibacterial classes to evaluate alternative effective treatments.

Synergistic effects of tetracyclines and macrolides were also observed.', 'A Review: Antimicrobial Therapy for Human Pythiosis  2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.Human pythiosis is associated with poor prognosis with significant mortality caused by Pythium insidiosum. Antimicrobials’ in vitro and in vivo results against P. insidiosum are inconsistent. Although antimicrobials are clinically useful, they are not likely to achieve therapeutic success alone without surgery and immunotherapy. New therapeutic options are therefore needed. This nonexhaustive review discusses the rationale antimicrobial therapy, minimum inhibitory concentrations, and efficacy of antibacterial and antifungal agents against P. insidiosum. This review further provides insight into the immunomodulating effects of antimicrobials that can enhance the immune response to infections. Current data support using antimicrobial combination therapy for the pharmacotherapeutic management of human pythiosis. Also, the success or failure of antimicrobial treatment in human pythiosis might depend on the immunomodulatory effects of drugs. The repurposing of existing drugs is a safe strategy for anti-P. insidiosum drug discovery. To improve patient outcomes in pythiosis, we suggest further research and a deeper understanding of P. insidiosum virulence factors, host immune response, and host immune system modification by antimicrobials.', 'Human Pythiosis: Emergence of Fungal-Like Organism  2019, Springer Nature B.V.Pythiosis is an emerging infectious disease caused by the aquatic oomycete Pythium insidiosum, a fungal-like organism. It is believed that P. insidiosum’s zoospores, its infected form, play major role in pathogenesis. Vascular and ocular infections are the most common clinical manifestation in humans. It is difficult to establish the diagnosis given its relatively rarity and difficulty to distinguish P. insidiosum from other molds. Delay in diagnosis and treatment has been associated with poor outcomes. High index of suspicion is the key, particularly in thalassemia patients with arterial insufficiency and patients with fungal keratitis/endophthalmitis without improvement on antifungal therapy. Tissue culture and zoospore induction remain gold standard for diagnosis; however, DNA-based method should be performed simultaneously. The combination of radical surgery, antifungal agents, and immunotherapy has been recommended. It was previously believed that surgery with negative surgical margins was the essential to survive in vascular pythiosis; however, it was recently found that patients could have residual disease despite documented negative surgical margins as infected clot may be dislodged to proximal arterial sites prior to surgery. Serum β-d-glucan (BG) has been used to monitor disease response after treatment initiation in vascular pythiosis. A significant decrease in BG levels within 2 weeks after surgery is indicative of the absence of residual infection. Unfortunately, monitoring tools for ocular pythiosis are not yet available. Itraconazole plus terbinafine have generally been used in P. insidiosum-infected patients; however, antibacterial agents, including azithromycin and linezolid, have also been used with favorable outcomes in ocular disease. Recently, azithromycin or clarithromycin plus doxycyclin were used in two relapsed vascular pythiosis patients with good outcomes.']"

Based on the ASAGAO combined map, which was created by combining ASAGAO and ALMA archival data in the GOODS-South field, we find that 24 ZFOURGE sources have 1.2 mm counterparts with a signal-to-noise ratio >4.5 (1σ ≃ 30-70 μJy beam−1 at 1.2 mm). Their median redshift is estimated to be zmedian = 2.38 ± 0.14. They generally follow the tight relationship of the stellar mass versus star formation rate (i.e., the main sequence of star-forming galaxies). ALMA-detected ZFOURGE sources exhibit systematically larger infrared (IR) excess (IRX ≡ LIR/LUV) compared to ZFOURGE galaxies without ALMA detections even though they have similar redshifts, stellar masses, and star formation rates. This implies the consensus stellar-mass versus IRX relation, which is known to be tight among rest-frame-ultraviolet-selected galaxies, cannot fully predict the ALMA detectability of stellar-mass-selected galaxies. We find that ALMA-detected ZFOURGE sources are the main contributors to the cosmic IR star formation rate density at z = 2-3.', ""GOODS-ALMA: The slow downfall of star formation in z = 2-3 massive galaxies  2020 M. Franco et al.We investigate the properties of a sample of 35 galaxies, detected with the Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array (ALMA) at 1.1 mm in the GOODS-ALMA field (area of 69 arcmin2, resolution = 0.60″, rms ≲ 0.18 mJy beam-1). Using the ultraviolet-to-radio deep multiwavelength coverage of the GOODS-South field, we fit the spectral energy distributions of these galaxies to derive their key physical properties. The galaxies detected by ALMA are among the most massive at z = 2-4 (Mmed = 8.5 × 1010 M·) and they are either starburst or located in the upper part of the galaxy star-forming main sequence. A significant portion of our galaxy population (∼40%), located at z ∼ 2.5 - 3, exhibits abnormally low gas fractions. The sizes of these galaxies, measured with ALMA, are compatible with the trend between the rest-frame 5000 Å size and stellar mass observed for z ∼ 2 elliptical galaxies, suggesting that they are building compact bulges. We show that there is a strong link between star formation surface density (at 1.1 mm) and gas depletion time: The more compact a galaxy's star-forming region is, the shorter its lifetime will be (without gas replenishment). The identified compact sources associated with relatively short depletion timescales (∼100 Myr) are the ideal candidates to be the progenitors of compact elliptical galaxies at z ∼2."", 'Starbursts in and out of the star-formation main sequence  ESO 2018.Aims. We use high-resolution continuum images obtained with the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) to probe the surface density of star formation in z ∼ 2 galaxies and study the different physical properties between galaxies within and above the star-formation main sequence of galaxies. Methods. We use ALMA images at 870 µm with 0.2 arcsec resolution in order to resolve star formation in a sample of eight star-forming galaxies at z ∼ 2 selected among the most massive Herschel galaxies in the GOODS-South field. This sample is supplemented with eleven galaxies from the public data of the 1.3 mm survey of the Hubble Ultra-Deep Field, HUDF. We derive dust and gas masses for the galaxies, compute their depletion times and gas fractions, and study the relative distributions of rest-frame ultraviolet (UV) and far-infrared (FIR) light. Results. ALMA reveals systematically dense concentrations of dusty star formation close to the center of the stellar component of the galaxies. We identify two different starburst regimes: (i) the classical population of starbursts located above the SFR-M main sequence, with enhanced gas fractions and short depletion times and (ii) a sub-population of galaxies located within the scatter of the main sequence that experience compact star formation with depletion timescales typical of starbursts of ∼150 Myr. In both starburst populations, the FIR and UV are distributed in distinct regions and dust-corrected star formation rates (SFRs) estimated using UV-optical-near-infrared data alone underestimate the total SFR. Starbursts hidden in the main sequence show instead the lowest gas fractions of our sample and could represent the last stage of star formation prior to passivization. Being Herschel-selected, these main sequence galaxies are located in the high-mass end of the main sequence, hence we do not know whether these “starbursts hidden in the main sequence” also exist below 1011 M. Active galactic nuclei (AGNs) are found to be ubiquitous in these compact starbursts, suggesting that the triggering mechanism also feeds the central black hole or that the active nucleus triggers star formation.']"

The model is validated by various measures, fits with the best model standards, meets all criteria of the goodness of fit, and is absent from any issues of heteroskedasticity, multicollinearity, autocorrelation, and non-normality. The proposed model is very distinct from other alternatives in that it produces the optimal outcome. Its mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) is 1.02% while the root mean square error (RMSE) is 1.51%. A comparison of the above results is carried out to compare the same values from other models, namely the regression linear model (ML model), back propagation neural network (BP model), artificial neural natural model (ANN model), gray model, and the autoregressive integrated moving average model (ARIMA model). The second order autoregressive-SEM is a model that is appropriate for long-term forecasting (2020-2035), and accounts for the specifics of the Thai government strategy set under the Industry 4.0 policy framework. The results of the long-term analysis indicate that the current political policy (Politi) will result in continuous economic growth, where the gross national product (GNP) growth rate will climb up to 6.45% per annum by 2035, while the environment is being negatively affected. The study predicts that CO2 emissions will rise up to 97.52 Mt CO2 Eq. (2035). The forecasting model also reflects that the economy factor has an adjustment ability to equilibrium stronger than that of the environment factor; further, it shows that the relationship between the factors is causal. In addition, the political policy (Politi), economy (Econ), and environment (Environ) factors are found to have both direct and indirect effects. As to the results, this study illustrates that the Industry 4.0 policy is still inefficient, as the carbon dioxide emissions are projected to be higher than the threshold for environment hazards and disasters which set to the limit of 80 Mt CO2 Eq. by 2035. The effect of such policy will put the environment at risk, and the government must take immediate action to respond to this urgency. Thus, the second order autoregressive-SEM model remains a significant model embedded with the adjustment ability to equilibrium and the applicability for various contexts in different sectors. This introduced model is a vital tool for assisting the national government to create policy that is effective and sustainable, and lead to positive development of the nation. This second order autoregressive-SEM model can be used as a resource for the management of both public policy and private enterprise."", 'Thailand Energy Scenarios: Pathways towards Carbon Neutrality 2050  2023, Econjournals. All rights reserved.“Carbon neutrality” has become a challenging target for the energy sector, which may lead to a major structural redesign of the sector. This may inevitably have an impact on the country’s economic structure. Future policies should be carefully formulated, taking into consideration both the positives and negatives, as well as the short-and long-term effects on the nation’s energy and economy in the future. This will ensure that the nation receives the maximum benefit in terms of energy security, carbon targets, environmental and social care, and sustainable economic growth. The various driving factors to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050 were analyzed based on the STEEP analysis, with an emphasis on the energy sector, which is found to make the largest contribution to greenhouse gas emissions. It found that political will, green technology, and financial incentives are the most influential factors in achieving the carbon neutrality target. These factors are considered as critical uncertainties when building two future scenarios for the energy sector. The Classic scenario reflects the attempt to achieve carbon neutrality with an emphasis on clean technologies, such as renewable energy, green hydrogen, and carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS). Meanwhile, the target will become even more challenging when energy efficiency is to be increased, such as electric vehicle. The Orchestra scenario shows how energy management, a decentralized energy system and promoting the prosumer market, especially in the residential sector, are used to try to reach carbon neutrality. In conclusion, both scenarios may result in the achievement of the 2050 carbon neutrality target. The Orchestra scenario may need planning, a holistic management approach, and active cooperation from various sectors. On the contrary, in the Classic scenario, most activities are restricted to the energy sector, which may entail some risks, particularly the rising demand for carbon offsets from other countries.', 'Fuel replacement: A possible option for Thailand energy security?  2020 Institute of Physics Publishing. All rights reserved.Natural gas has been playing an important role in strengthening energy security of Thailand as over 60 percent of total natural gas consumed in the country is from the Gulf of Thailand. In the past 20 years, the average growth of natural gas demand is 5.5 percent per year. Thanks to its low carbon content, natural gas is considered as cleaner fuel comparing to other fossil-based fuels. Still, there are usages of carbon-intensive fuels such as fuel oil and coal in Thailand e.g. in the industrial sector. Most of fuel oil and coal consumed are imported from foreign countries. Replacing these fuels with natural gas may be an option for the country to promote domestic clean energy and reduce overall carbon emissions. This paper forecasts the possibility of replacing fuel oil and coal in the industrial sector with natural gas. The research starts with examining the limitations of Thai regulations, estimating the amount of natural gas required for the replacement, and forecasting future prices of all three fuels. The price projection shows an attractive option for fuel oil users as the long term price of natural gas is projected to be lower than that of fuel oil. On the contrary, the projected coal price alone will not encourage coal users to switch their fuels. Thus, strong government measures will be required to stimulate coal replacement. The result of the study will be useful for determining appropriate policies to support long-term demand for natural gas of the country.']"

Other mutations in Pfcrt can modulate susceptibility of P. falciparum to other antimalarials capable of interfering with heme detoxification process, and may exert compensatory effect on parasite growth rate. To address whether nationwide implementation of artemisinin combination therapy (ACT) in Thailand could affect sequence variation in exon 2 and introns of Pfcrt, we analyzed 136 P. falciparum isolates collected during 1997 and 2016 from endemic areas bordering Myanmar, Cambodia and Malaysia. Results revealed 6 haplotypes in exon 2 of Pfcrt with 2 novel substitutions at c.243A > G (p.R81) and c.251A > T (p.N84I). Positive selection was observed at amino acid residues 75, 76 and 97. Four, 3, and 2 alleles of microsatellite (AT/TA) repeats occurred in introns 1, 2 and 4, respectively, resulting in 7 different 3-locus haplotypes. The number of haplotypes and haplotype diversity of exon 2, and introns 1, 2 and 4 were significantly greater among isolates collected during 2009 and 2016 than those collected during 1997 and 2008 when 3-day ACT and 2-day ACT regimens were implemented nationwide, respectively (p < 0.05). By contrast, the number of haplotypes and haplotype diversity of the merozoite surface proteins 1 and 2 of these parasite populations did not differ significantly between these periods. Therefore, the Pfcrt locus of P. falciparum in Thailand continues to evolve and could have been affected by selective pressure from modification of ACT regimen.', 'Structural diversity, natural selection and intragenic recombination in the Plasmodium vivax merozoite surface protein 9 locus in Thailand  2020 Elsevier B.V.The merozoite surface protein 9 (MSP9) of malarial parasite forms co-ligand complex with the 19 kDa fragment of merozoite surface protein 1 (MSP1) prior to erythrocyte invasion. Interruption of this process could hamper subsequent asexual erythrocytic development of malaria parasites; therefore, these proteins are considered potential vaccine candidates. In Plasmodium vivax, MSP9 (PvMSP9) contains both conserved and polymorphic repetitive domains that were immunogenic upon natural malaria exposure and conferred protection in vaccination studies in animal models. To investigate the extent of sequence diversity at this locus, 104 P. vivax isolates from 4 major malaria endemic areas of Thailand were analyzed. Results revealed that pvmsp9 contained 3 repeat domains (R1–R3) flanked by conserved domains. Repeat domains exhibit extensive sequence and length variation, in which 14, 39 and 16 haplotypes for domains R1–R3, respectively, circulated in this country. Sequence diversity in pvmsp9 among P. vivax isolates from each endemic area displayed population structure. The extent of sequence diversity in pvmsp9 isolates from the provinces of Tak, Chanthaburi, Ubon Ratchathani and Prachuap Khiri Khan in northwestern, eastern, northeastern and southwestern areas, respectively, was almost comparable and was remarkably higher than that from Yala/Narathiwat population in southern Thailand. Evidence for intragenic recombination in this locus was observed within each P. vivax population except among isolates from Yala and Narathiwat. Synonymous nucleotide diversity significantly exceeded nonsynonymous nucleotide diversity in domains R2 and R3, indicating purifying selection. However, micro-scale signatures of positive and negative selections occurred in both conserved and repeat domains, implying two opposing forces, probably from functional or structural constraint and host immune pressure, could have influenced diversity at this locus. The immunodominant T and B cell epitopes so far identified were invariant or highly conserved across isolates. Further analysis of global isolates is warranted for vaccine design based on this protein.', 'Global sequence diversity of the lactate dehydrogenase gene in Plasmodium falciparum  2018 The Author(s).Background: Antigen-detecting rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) have been recommended by the World Health Organization for use in remote areas to improve malaria case management. Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) of Plasmodium falciparum is one of the main parasite antigens employed by various commercial RDTs. It has been hypothesized that the poor detection of LDH-based RDTs is attributed in part to the sequence diversity of the gene. To test this, the present study aimed to investigate the genetic diversity of the P. falciparum ldh gene in Thailand and to construct the map of LDH sequence diversity in P. falciparum populations worldwide. Methods: The ldh gene was sequenced for 50 P. falciparum isolates in Thailand and compared with hundreds of sequences from P. falciparum populations worldwide. Several indices of molecular variation were calculated, including the proportion of polymorphic sites, the average nucleotide diversity index (π), and the haplotype diversity index (H). Tests of positive selection and neutrality tests were performed to determine signatures of natural selection on the gene. Mean genetic distance within and between species of Plasmodium ldh was analysed to infer evolutionary relationships. Results: Nucleotide sequences of P. falciparum ldh could be classified into 9 alleles, encoding 5 isoforms of LDH. L1a was the most common allelic type and was distributed in P. falciparum populations worldwide. Plasmodium falciparum ldh sequences were highly conserved, with haplotype and nucleotide diversity values of 0.203 and 0.0004, respectively. The extremely low genetic diversity was maintained by purifying selection, likely due to functional constraints. Phylogenetic analysis inferred the close genetic relationship of P. falciparum to malaria parasites of great apes, rather than to other human malaria parasites. Conclusions: This study revealed the global genetic variation of the ldh gene in P. falciparum, providing knowledge for improving detection of LDH-based RDTs and supporting the candidacy of LDH as a therapeutic drug target.']"

Methods: We prospectively recruited patients with focal epilepsy who were admitted to the epilepsy monitoring unit for presurgical evaluation during January to December 2020. All study participants were simultaneously applied gold standard long-term video-electroencephalographic (EEG) monitoring and an index test, E4. Two certified epileptologists independently determined whether captured events were seizures and then indicated ictal semiology and EEG information. Both were blind to multimodal biosignal findings detected by E4. Biosignals during 5-min epochs of both seizure events and baseline were collected and compared. Predictive models for occurrence overall and of each seizure type were developed using a generalized estimating equation. Diagnostic performance of each model was then assessed. Results: Thirty patients had events recorded and were recruited for analysis. One hundred eight seizure events and 120 baseline epochs were collected. Heart rate (HR), acceleration (ACC), and electrodermal activity (EDA) but not temperature were significantly elevated during seizures. Cluster analysis showed trends of greatest elevation of HR and ACC in bilateral tonic–clonic seizures (BTCs), as compared with non-BTCs and isolated auras. HR and ACC were independent predictors for overall seizure types, BTCs, and non-BTCs, whereas only HR was a predictor for isolated aura. Diagnostic performance including sensitivity, specificity, and area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve of the predictive model for overall seizures were 77.78%, 60%, and.696 (95% confidence interval =.628–.764), respectively. Significance: Multimodal extracerebral biosignals (HR, ACC, EDA) detected by a wrist-worn smartwatch can help differentiate between epileptic seizures and normal physical activities. It would be worthwhile to implement our predictive algorithms in commercial seizure detection devices. However, larger studies to externally validate our predictive models are required.']"

Plasma and 24 h urine samples were collected to measure urinary pH, mineral excretion and urinary total antioxidant status, plasma for creatinine and plasma protein carbonyl, and stone for elemental analysis at the initiation and end-of-treatment (6 month). Adverse effects were recorded. Results: Administration of LPR significantly increased urinary pH, citrate and potassium excretion. Urinary levels of calcium and oxalate, and plasma protein carbonyl content were reduced, while urinary total antioxidant status was elevated by LPR treatment. Urinary supersaturation was decreased and urinary protein excretion was ameliorated in LPR-treated patients. Gastrointestinal adverse effects were rarely observed. None of the participants developed stone recurrence for the duration of the trial. Conclusion: Lime power regimen is a potential drug to correct urinary metabolic disorders associated with urolithiasis in high risk stone recurrent patients. A phase 3 clinical trial is underway to validate anti-stone recurrence property of LPR in long-term treatment.', 'Clinical validation of urinary indole-reacted calcium oxalate crystallization index (iCOCI) test for diagnosing calcium oxalate urolithiasis  2020, The Author(s).An indole-reacted calcium oxalate crystallization index (iCOCI) test was developed to quantify the total competence of urine to precipitate calcium oxalate (CaOx) crystals. We conducted the prospective cohort study in accordance with the STARD guideline to evaluate the accuracy of urinary iCOCI test (index test) for diagnosing urolithiasis. A total of 281 participants were recruited for the study. Levels of urinary iCOCI were determined in the pre-diagnostic 24-h urine samples. Positive urinary iCOCI (≥ 0.6 COM eqv., g/L) was accounted for 51% (144/281), and the rest of 49% (137/281) were negative. Non-contrast CT imaging (reference standard) was subsequently performed for the definite diagnosis of urolithiasis to divide the participants into two groups, non-stone subjects (NSS, n = 122) and stone-forming subjects (SFS, n = 159). It should be noted that only subjects who currently had urinary stone at the time of study were classified as SFS. Urinary iCOCI levels in the SFS were significantly higher than the NSS. ROC analysis revealed an area under curve (AUC) of 0.893 (95% CI: 0.855–0.932) in separating NSS from all SFS. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), accuracy, positive likelihood ratio (LH+) and negative likelihood ratio (LH−) of urinary iCOCI test for diagnosis of all urolithiasis were 87%, 80%, 84%, 84%, 83%, 4.44 and 0.16, respectively. Of 159 SFS, 38 were confirmed to have CaOx stones. Among these 38 CaOx SFS, only 2 had negative urinary iCOCI test. The AUC of urinary iCOCI test for separating CaOx SFS from NSS was markedly high (0.946, 95% CI: 0.914–0.978). Sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV, accuracy, LH+ and LH− of urinary iCOCI test for diagnosing CaOx urolithiasis were 95%, 86%, 68%, 98%, 88%, 6.80 and 0.06, respectively. Conclusion, we clinically validated that an innovative non-invasive urinary iCOCI test was highly accurate to diagnose urolithiasis, especially CaOx stone. With its high sensitivity and NPV, urinary iCOCI test is clinically intended to use as a screening test for CaOx urolithiasis. LH− of 0.06 indicates that negative result of urinary iCOCI test is highly accurate to rule out the CaOx stone formation. It is noted that urinary iCOCI level is expressed as arbitrary unit, and it is not directly related to the actual physiological level of urinary oxalate.', 'A urinary proteomic study in hypercalciuric dogs with and without calcium oxalate urolithiasis Copyright:  Chamsuwan, et al.Background and Aims: Hypercalciuria is an important predisposing factor commonly found in humans and dogs with calcium oxalate (CaOx) urolithiasis. Calcium oxalate crystals can induce an inflammatory reaction that subsequently produces several proteins that have an inhibitory or stimulatory effect on stone formation. This study aimed to evaluate the differences in urinary proteomic profiles between hypercalciuric CaOx stone dogs and hypercalciuric stone-free dogs (CaOx stone and control groups, respectively). Materials and Methods: Seven dogs with hypercalciuric CaOx urolithiasis and breed-, sex-, and aged-matched controls with hypercalciuria were included in the study. Serum and urine samples were obtained from all dogs to analyze electrolytes. Urinary proteomic profiles were analyzed using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Student’s t-test was used to compare the differences between groups. Results: Forty-nine urinary proteins were identified in the stone-free and CaOx stone groups, whereas 19 and 6 proteins were unique in the CaOx stone and stone-free groups, respectively. The urinary thrombomodulin level was significantly higher in the CaOx stone group (relative ratio = 1.8, p < 0.01) than in the stone-free group. Conclusion: This study demonstrated that urinary proteomic profiles may be used as a candidate biomarker for urinary tract injury in CaOx urolithiasis in dogs.']"

The concurrent systems, with time attributes on transactions, are typically written in time Petri net. For quantitative and qualitative analysis of their properties, these time Petri net would be transformed into Promela beforehand. We also propose the linear temporal formula to specify the correctness properties. The proposed transforming method copes with the representation of both Petri net structure and its dynamic behavior. The token flows in time Petri net are modelled into Promela code, hence the implicit dynamic behavior would be practically described in the model. The resulting Promela code is simulated and verified by SPIN tool and reveals that not only the time related behaviors would be evaluated, but also the qualitative properties, such as safety and liveness.', 'Event-B formalization of basic supply chain patterns  2018 IEEE.In recent years, as supply chains are increasingly becoming more valuable and dynamic, a large variety of compliance with high quality is needed for total safety and reliability. Several business process models were proposed to cope with the increasing risk and complexity of the supply chain operations and events, especially when the unexpected events, caused by the time dependent behaviors, occur. Formal verification approach becomes more interesting choice as the preventive checking of the safety and correctness of a real-time system specification from the very beginning of the design phase. In practice, a timed Petri net as a formal model is commonly used to graphically illustrate the time dependent behaviors of a real-time system. However, the simulation of the timed Petri net is tedious and inefficient for verifying the huge and complex realtime system. Alternatively, Event-B formalization approach provides an efficient and better automatic proving tool, whilst the writing Event-B specification from scratch needs the designer with the mathematical logic backgrounds. In this paper, we still encourage the drawing of an ordinary timed Petri net (OTPN) as a formal model of the supply chain events which is easier and more understandable in the first place. Moreover, we expect that several basic supply chain event patterns, as building blocks of ordinary timed Petri net notations, would help ease the construction of the formal model of the complex production processes. We hereafter propose a mean to transform the given ordinary timed Petri net of the supply chain event patterns into a complete Event-B specification which will be automatically proved by an Event-B prover called Rodin.', 'Automatic transformation of ordinary timed petri nets into Event-B for formal verification  2018, Chulalongkorn University. All rights reserved.The behavioral correctness of real-time software systems relies on both the results of its computation and the clock times when the results are produced. Obviously, formal verification of the safety and correctness of real-time software specification from the very beginning of the software design phase obviously helps us reduce the development efforts. From a practical point of view, the timed Petri net is commonly used to graphically model and illustrate the view of the timed behavior of real-time software systems, which is a good basis for an understanding of a model. However, there is a lack of development process software for the simulation of a timed Petri net. Alternatively, formal verification using the Event-B specification method provides an efficient automatic theorem proving tool which is focused on the development process and provides an efficient verified internal data of software. Unfortunately writing an Event-B specification from scratch is still difficult and a mathematical logic background is needed. In this paper, we propose an automatic transformation of ordinary timed Petri nets into Event-B specifications. The basic notations in the ordinary timed Petri nets are considered and mapped into the code fragments of Event-B. The final resulting Event-B codes are generated in the well-formed format which is required and successfully verified by an Event-B prover called a Rodin tool.']"

Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.Osteoarthritis (OA) is a degenerative joint disease leading to joint pain and stiffness. Due to lack of effective treatments, physical and psychological disabilities caused by OA have a detrimental impact on the patient’s quality of life. Emerging evidence suggests that intra-articular injection of platelet-rich plasma (PRP) may provide favorable results since PRP comprises not only a high level of platelets but also a huge amount of cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors. However, the precise mechanism and standardization method remain uncertain. This study aimed to examine cytokine profiling in both PRP and platelet-poor plasma (PPP) of knee OA patients and to determine the effects of PRP on OA chondrocytes and knee OA patients. PRP contained a wide variety of cytokines, chemokines, growth factors, and autologous intra-articular PRP injection resulted in favorable outcomes in knee OA patients. Significant increases in levels of IL-1, IL-2, IL-7, IL-8, IL-9, IL-12, TNF-α, IL-17, PDGF-BB, bFGF, and MIP-1β were detected in PRP compared to PPP (p < 0.001). An in vitro study showed a marked increase in proliferation in OA chondrocytes cultured with PRP, compared to PPP and fetal bovine serum (p < 0.001). In a clinical study, knee OA patients treated with PRP showed improvement of physical function and pain, assessed by physical performance, Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index and visual analog scale. Our findings from both in vitro and clinical studies suggest that intra-articular PRP injection in knee OA patients may be a potential therapeutic strategy for alleviating knee pain and delaying the need for surgery.', 'Clusterin Is Associated with Systemic and Synovial Inflammation in Knee Osteoarthritis  The Author(s) 2020.Objectives: This study aimed to determine possible associations between transcriptional and translational levels of clusterin (CLU) in the systemic and local joint environments with the severity of knee osteoarthritis (OA) and to investigate CLU mRNA expression in knee OA fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLSs) stimulated with tumor necrosis factor-α. Design: Circulating and synovial fluid CLU levels in 259 knee OA patients were quantified using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Relative CLU mRNA expression in 50 knee OA synovial tissues and 4 knee OA FLSs was determined using real-time polymerase chain reaction. Results: Plasma CLU levels of knee OA patients were significantly higher than paired synovial fluid samples. Compared with early-stage knee OA patients, those with advanced-stage OA had considerably increased plasma and synovial fluid CLU levels. There were significant positive associations of plasma and synovial fluid CLU levels with radiographic severity of knee OA. Plasma CLU levels were directly correlated with its synovial fluid levels and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein levels in the patients. Receiver-operating characteristic curve analysis unveiled the potential utility of plasma CLU as a novel biomarker for knee OA severity (AUC = 0.80), with a sensitivity of 71.4% and a specificity of 73.3%. Marked upregulation of CLU mRNA expression was observed in both the inflamed synovial tissues and FLSs of knee OA. Conclusion: Increased CLU mRNA and protein levels in the systemic and local joint environments of knee OA might reflect knee OA severity, especially systemic and synovial inflammation.', 'Diagnostic Value of Interleukin-34 as a Novel Biomarker for Severity of Knee Osteoarthritis  The Author(s) 2021.Objectives: This study aimed to determine whether plasma and synovial fluid interleukin-34 (IL-34), an inflammatory cytokine reportedly implicated in synovial inflammation-induced joint degeneration, were associated with radiographic severity of knee osteoarthritis (OA) patients and could emerge as knee OA biomarkers. Design: Ninety-six knee OA patients and 72 healthy controls were recruited. Plasma and synovial fluid IL-34 levels were quantified using ELISA. IL-34 mRNA and protein expressions in inflamed (n = 15) and noninflamed synovial tissues (n = 15) of knee OA patients were determined using real-time polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry, respectively. Results: Significant increases in plasma and synovial fluid IL-34 levels were found in knee OA patients—especially those with advanced stage (P < 0.001, P < 0.001, respectively). Both plasma and synovial fluid IL-34 levels were positively associated with radiographic severity (r = 0.64, P < 0.001; r = 0.50, P < 0.001, respectively). There was a direct link between plasma and synovial fluid IL-34 (r = 0.64, P < 0.001). Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis uncovered that the optimal cutoff value of plasma IL-34 as a novel biomarker reflecting knee OA severity was defined at 3750.0 pg/mL (AUC = 0.85), with a sensitivity of 83.1% and a specificity of 74.2%. Further analysis revealed that IL-34 mRNA expression was significantly upregulated in inflamed synovium compared with noninflamed synovium obtained from knee OA patients (P < 0.001), consistent with protein expression analysis demonstrating IL-34 overexpression localized in the lining and sublining layers of inflamed synovium. Conclusions: All findings suggest that elevated plasma and synovial fluid IL-34 would reflect knee OA severity and might have potential utility as biomarkers for the disease progression.']"

A series of pullout tests was carried out to analyze the bond mechanism between ETS bars and concrete for various influences such as embedment length and ETS stiffness. Together with previous data, a comprehensive analytical method for defining the ETS–concrete interfacial profile is proposed. Additionally, the proposed bond model is used to build a new method of predicting the ETS shear resisting force and assessing the absorption energy of strengthened beams. Results indicate that the developed bond model is reasonable for simulating ETS–concrete interfaces, and the method for deriving the shear contribution of ETS FRP bars through bonding-based mechanism shows good performance compared to other shear models. Bonding parameters such as interfacial ductility index (B) and interfacial energy (Gf) are observed to strongly affect the performance of strengthened members. Moreover, finite element (FE) simulations of beams strengthened with ETS bars were conducted, and the proposed bonding approach was utilized. Comparisons between the results achieved from FE modeling and experiments clarify that FE simulation with the proposed bond model is effective for analyzing shear strengthened beams by ETS bars.', 'Experimental Investigation of Concrete Beams Strengthened with Embedded Through-Section Steel and FRP Bars  2020 American Society of Civil Engineers.This paper presents an experimental investigation on reinforced concrete (RC) beams strengthened in shear with embedded through-section (ETS) steel and fiber reinforced polymer (FRP) bars anchored with and without a mechanical anchorage system. The responses of the beams, including the load-deflection relationship, crack patterns, modes of failure, and reinforcement strain, are discussed. In addition, the shear performances of different strengthening systems are analyzed by comparing the ETS cases with ordinary reinforcement techniques. The effects of different types of ETS strengthening are considered in the presence of varying numbers of steel stirrups. An investigation of the shear contribution of the strengthening bars is carried out to assess the applicability of existing models. An average strain equation for ETS-FRP bars is developed from original models. Comparisons of the results obtained from this paper with those reported in the literature demonstrate that the end anchored ETS strengthening system provides a significant improvement in the shear strengthening efficiency. Furthermore, the truss analogy combined with the developed average strain formulation is an effective method to predict the shear resisting force of anchored ETS-FRP bars in ETS-FRP strengthened beams.', 'Experimental and Analytical Study on Shear Performance of Embedded Through-Section GFRP-Strengthened RC Beams  2022 American Society of Civil Engineers.The structural performance of reinforced concrete (RC) beams strengthened in shear with embedded through-section (ETS) glass fiber-reinforced polymer (GFRP) bars is experimentally and analytically investigated. Three-point bending tests are performed. The investigated parameters include the number of existing steel stirrups (ρsw = 0.28%), concrete compressive strength (fc′ = 27 and 43 MPa), shear span-to-effective depth ratio (a/d = 2.4, 3.6, and 4.8), anchorage presence (with and without anchorage), and anchorage properties (steel and GFRP anchorage systems, as well as the anchorage length). The results indicate that the shear capacity and stiffness of the beams are enhanced by applying ETS-GFRP, increasing concrete strength, and decreasing shear span-to-effective depth ratio. The ETS-GFRP-strengthened beams exhibit a more ductile failure mode than the unstrengthened beam owing to concrete crushing in loading areas. The beam stiffness depends significantly on the anchorage presence and properties, and the beam shear capacities differ considerably for different anchorage systems. Anchorage with four steel nuts or two GFRP nuts at the ETS bar ends provides the highest shear resistance and stiffness for the ETS-strengthened beams. The results of this study suggest that the details and configuration of the anchorage system should be carefully considered for the development of unanimous specifications. Additionally, previously proposed shear models can be used to conservatively analyze test results with sufficient accuracy. The newly developed model for estimation of the shear strengths of ETS-GFRP-strengthened beams and the effective strains in ETS-GFRP bars agrees well with the test data. Practical Applications The experimental results obtained from the present study demonstrate the potential of the embedded through-section (ETS) method for practical applications in the shear strengthening of the reinforced concrete (RC) beams. The predrilled holes through the beam height are made at the marked positions, which could be determined by a rebar detector. Next, the adhesive resin is fully injected into the holes prior embedding the fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP) bars. In the present study, the glass fiber-reinforced polymer (GFRP) bars are used. Then, the ends of each FRP bar are anchored with screwed nuts. Comparing with the unstrengthened beam, the ETS-strengthened beam offers a larger capacity, more ductility, and safer failure. The shear performance of the ETS-strengthened beams is proportional to the concrete compressive strength. The decrease of the shear span-to-effective depth ratio increases the shear resistance of the ETS-strengthened beams. The anchorage at two bar ends with two GFRP or four steel nuts is deemed to be most effective. Additionally, the proposed shear strength model can be used for the design of the beam with an ETS strengthening system.']"

However, studies describing the impact of long-term ART and CD4 count recovery on TB incidence remain scarce due to limited follow up in previous studies. We evaluated TB incidence in a long-term cohort of PLWH on ART in Thailand. Methods: We conducted an analysis of PLWH aged ≥ 18 years who started ART between 1996 and December 2020. Participants were followed up every 6 months for routine HIV care. TB risk factors, body mass index (BMI), physical examination and full differential blood counts were evaluated at each clinic visit, and CD4 cell counts and HIV RNA every 12 months. Participants diagnosed with TB > 3 months after starting ART were classified as incident cases. Time to event models with death as a competing risk, were used to derive the TB cumulative incidence function (CIF) after ART initiation, and assess time-updated factors associated with incident TB using a six month lag. Results: A total of 2,636 PLWH contributing 24,229 person years (PY) of follow-up on ART were analysed. Median age was 32.0 (IQR 27.4–37.6) years; 67.5% were male. Median CD4 cell count at ART initiation was 264 (IQR 167–379) cells/mm3 and median follow-up duration was 7.6 (IQR 1.9–15.7) years. During follow-up, 113 PLWH developed TB. The probability of incident TB was 0.7%, 1.7%, 3.3% and 4.3%, at 1, 2, 5 and 7 years after ART initiation, respectively. TB CIF was highest among participants with CD4 < 50 cells/mm3. The overall crude incidence of TB was 4.66 (95% CI 3.87–5.60) per 1000 PY. Low CD4 count, BMI < 18 kg/m2, and substance use in the previous six months were significantly associated with incident TB. Incidence declined with time on suppressive ART, but remained higher than the Thai general population 7 years after ART initiation (2.2 vs 1.5/1000 PY, respectively). Conclusion: Despite a marked reduction in TB incidence following ART, ongoing TB risk remains high among PLWH, despite long-term suppressive ART. Those with low CD4 cell counts, who are underweight, or currently having substance abuse should be carefully monitored.', 'Temporal trend of drug-resistant tuberculosis among Thai children during 2006–2021  2022 The Author(s)Background: The prevalence of drug-resistant tuberculosis (DR-TB) in adults has stabilized in the past decade. Our study aimed to describe the prevalence of DR-TB in Thai children between 2006 and 2021. Materials and methods: Children younger than 15 years old who had culture-confirmed Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTB), positive PCR-MTB, or positive Xpert MTB/RIF were included in this cohort. Drug susceptibility testing (DST) was performed using phenotypic and/or genotypic methods. The prevalence of DR-TB was compared using the chi-square test. Results: Among 163 confirmed TB cases (44% as pulmonary TB, 27% as extrapulmonary TB, and 29% with both), the median age (IQR) was 12.2 (7.3–14.2) years.

Therefore, we determined the incidence of active TB and mortality among 9179 adult PLWH who attended and received ART from 15 tertiary care hospitals across Thailand. Methods: A retrospective study was conducted in 2018 using follow-up data from 1999 to 2018. The primary endpoint was incident TB disease after ART initiation. Factors associated with TB incidence were analysed using competing risk regression. The Kaplan–Meier method was used to estimate mortality after ART initiation. Results: During a median of 5.1 years of ART (IQR 2.2–9.5 years), 442 (4.8%) PLWH developed TB (TB/HIV), giving an overall incidence of 750 (95% CI 683–823) per 100,000 persons-year of follow up (PYFU). In multivariate analysis, lower CD4 at ART initiation (≤100 cells/mm3, adjusted sub-distribution hazard ratio [aSHR]: 2.08, 95% CI, 1.47–2.92; 101–200 cells/mm3, aSHR: 2.21, 95% CI, 1.54–3.16; 201–350 cells/mm3, aSHR: 1.59, 95% CI, 1.11–2.28 vs. >350 cells/mm3), male sex (aSHR: 1.40, 95% CI, 1.11–1.78), lower body weight (<50 kg, aSHR: 1.52, 95% CI, 1.17–1.95) and prior TB event (aSHR: 3.50, 95% CI, 2.72–4.52) were associated with TB incidence. PLWH with HIV RNA ≥50 copies/ml had 5–9 times higher risk of active TB disease higher than those with HIV RNA <50 copies/ml at the same CD4 level. The risk for developing TB was remarkably high during the initial period of ART (175,511 per 100,000 PYFU at<3 months) and was comparable to the general population after 10 years of ART (151 per 100,000 PYFU). TB/HIV had higher mortality (10% vs. 5%) and poorer HIV treatment outcomes: HIV RNA <50 copies/ml (63.8% vs. 82.8%), CD4 cells count (317 vs. 508 cells/mm3) at the most recent visit. Conclusions: In this high TB burden country, TB incidence was remarkably high during the first few years after ART initiation and thereafter decreased significantly. Rapid ART initiation and appropriate TPT can be potential key interventions to tackle the TB epidemic and reduce mortality among PLWH in TB/HIV high burden settings.']"

The acpcPNA was covalently immobilized onto partially oxidized cellulose paper via reductive alkylation between the amine and the aldehyde groups. The fluorescence-based detection was performed by monitoring the fluorescence signal response of a fluorescent dye that selectively binds to the single-strand region of the DNA target over the PNA probe employing a custom-made portable fluorescent camera gadget in combination with a smartphone camera. Under the optimal conditions, a linear relationship between the fluorescence change in the green channel and the amount of HCV DNA from 5 to 100 pmol with a correlation coefficient of 0.9956, and the limit of detection of 5 pmol were obtained for short synthetic oligonucleotides. The acpcPNA probe exhibited very high selectivity for the complementary oligonucleotides over the single-base-mismatched, two-base-mismatched, and non-complementary DNA targets. Benefitting from the signal amplification achieved through the numerous binding sites for the dye provided by the overhanging tail of long ssDNA target sequences, this system was successfully applied to detect the HCV complementary DNA (cDNA) obtained from clinical samples with satisfactory results.

The semi-rigid PNA backbone acts as a scaffold that arranges the nucleobases in a proper orientation and spacing so that they can pair with their complementary bases on another DNA, RNA, or even PNA strand perfectly well through the standard Watson-Crick base-pairing. The electrostatically neutral backbone of PNA contributes to its many unique properties that make PNA an outstanding member of the xeno-nucleic acid family. Not only PNA can recognize its complementary nucleic acid strand with high affinity, but it does so with excellent specificity that surpasses the specificity of natural nucleic acids and their analogs. Nevertheless, there is still room for further improvements of the original PNA in terms of stability and specificity of base-pairing, direction of binding, and selectivity for different types of nucleic acids, among others. This review focuses on attempts towards the rational design of new generation PNAs with superior performance by introducing conformational constraints such as a ring or a chiral substituent in the PNA backbone. A large collection of conformationally rigid PNAs developed during the past three decades are analyzed and compared in terms of molecular design and properties in relation to structural data if available. Applications of selected modified PNA in various areas such as targeting of structured nucleic acid targets, supramolecular scaffold, biosensing and bioimaging, and gene regulation will be highlighted to demonstrate how the conformation constraint can improve the performance of the PNA. Challenges and future of the research in the area of constrained PNA will also be discussed.', 'Enhancing Peptide Nucleic Acid-Nanomaterial Interaction and Performance Improvement of Peptide Nucleic Acid-Based Nucleic Acid Detection by Using Electrostatic Effects  2022 American Chemical SocietySingle-stranded peptide nucleic acid (PNA) probes interact strongly with several nanomaterials, and the interaction was diminished in the presence of complementary nucleic acid targets which forms the basis of many nucleic acid sensing platforms. As opposed to the negatively charged DNA probes, the charges on the PNA probes may be fine-tuned by incorporating amino acids with charged side chains. The contribution of electrostatic effects to the interaction between PNA probes and nanomaterials has been largely overlooked. This work reveals that electrostatic effects substantially enhanced the quenching of dye-labeled conformationally constrained pyrrolidinyl PNA probes by several nanomaterials including graphene oxide (GO), reduced graphene oxide, gold nanoparticles (AuNPs), and silver nanoparticles. The fluorescence quenching and the color change from red to purple in the case of AuNPs because of aggregation were inhibited in the presence of complementary nucleic acid targets. Thus, fluorescence and colorimetric assays for DNA and RNA that can distinguish even single-base-mismatched nucleic acids with improved sensitivity over conventional DNA probes were established. Both the GO- and AuNP-based sensing platforms have been successfully applied for the detection of real DNA and RNA samples in vitro and in living cells. This study emphasizes the active roles of electrostatic effects in the PNA-nanomaterial interactions, which paves the way toward improving the performance of PNA-nanomaterial based assays of nucleic acids.']"

All rights reserved.AbstractPursed-lip breathing (PLB) and forward trunk lean posture (FTLP) are commonly used to relieve dyspnea and improve ventilation in a rehabilitation program. However, their effect on chest wall volumes and movements in older adults without chronic obstructive pulmonary disease has never been investigated. This observational study aimed to identify the effect of combined PLB and FTLP on total and regional chest wall volumes, ventilatory pattern, and thoracoabdominal movement using in older adults. It was hypothesized that the combined PLB with FTLP would result in the highest chest wall volumes among the experimental tasks. Twenty older adults performed 2 breathing patterns of quiet breathing (QB) and PLB during a seated upright (UP) position and FTLP. An optoelectronic plethysmography system was used to capture the chest wall movements during the 4 experimental tasks. Tidal volume (VT) was separated into pulmonary ribcage, abdominal ribcage, and abdomen volume. The changes in anterior-posterior (AP) and medial-lateral (ML) chest wall diameters at 3 levels were measured and used to identify chest wall mechanics to improve chest wall volumes. The PLB significantly improved ventilation and chest wall volumes than the QB (P < .05). VTof pulmonary ribcage, VTof abdominal ribcage, and VTwere significantly higher during the PLB + UP (P < .05) and during the PLB + FTLP (P < .01) as compared to those of QB performed in similar body positions. However, there was no significant in total and regional lung volumes between the PLB + UP and the PLB + FTLP. The AP diameter changes at the angle of Louis and xiphoid levels were greater during the PLB + UP than the QB + UP and the QB + FTLP (P < .01). The AP diameter changes at the umbilical level and the ML diameter changes at the xiphoid level were significantly larger during the PLB + FTLP than the QB + FTLP and the QB + UP (P < .05). The ML diameter changes at the umbilical level were significantly greater during the PLB + FTLP than the QB + UP (P < .05). However, no significant difference in the relative regional chest wall volumes and phase angle among the experimental tasks (P > .05). In conclusion, a combined PLB performed in an FTLP or UP sitting could be used as a strategy to improve chest wall volumes and ventilation in older adults.', 'Alternating high-intensity interval training and continuous training is efficacious in improving cardiometabolic health in obese middle-aged men  2021 The Society of Chinese Scholars on Exercise Physiology and FitnessBackground: High-intensity interval training (HIIT) or moderate-intensity continuous training (MICT) alone has been shown to improve metabolic health, but the effects of alternating the two training approaches as often practiced in real life remained unclear. Purpose: To examine the effects of HIIT or MICT alone or alternating HIIT-MICT on cardiometabolic responses in inactive obese middle-aged men. Methods: Forty-two participants (age: 42 ± 5 y; BMI: 26.3 ± 2.1 kg m−2) were randomly assigned to four groups: HIIT (12 x 1-min running bouts at 80–90% HRmax interspersed with 1-min active recovery at 50% HRmax), MICT (40-min brisk walk at 65–70% HRmax), alternating HIIT-MICT or a non-exercise control group (CON). Exercise sessions were conducted three times per week for 16 weeks. Maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max), body composition (by bioelectrical impedance analysis), blood pressure, fasting blood glucose, insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) and lipid profile were assessed at baseline and after the 16-week intervention. Enjoyment and self-efficacy were also assessed at the end of intervention. Results: All exercise groups showed a similar VO2max increase of ∼15% (HIIT: 34.3 ± 4.4 vs 39.1 ± 5.4; MICT: 34.9 ± 5.0 vs 39.4 ± 7.2; and alternating HIIT-MICT: 34.4 ± 5.0 vs 40.3 ± 4.6 mL kg−1min−1) compared to baseline and CON (all p < 0.05). Weight, BMI, % fat and waist circumference also showed similar reductions in all exercise groups compared to baseline and CON (all p < 0.05). No significant group difference was observed for all blood markers. Compared to baseline, total cholesterol decreased after HIIT-MICT, while HIIT significantly decreased fasting insulin level and improved insulin resistance (p < 0.05). Enjoyment, self-efficacy and adherence were similar among all exercise groups. Conclusion: HIIT or MICT alone or alternating HIIT-MICT similarly improve cardiovascular fitness and body composition in obese middle-aged men despite differences in total training volume and time commitment.', 'Comparison of the effect of hot and thermo-neutral environments on fat oxidation during post-exercise recovery in exercise-trained obese women: A preliminary report  2021, Walailak University. All rights reserved.Exercise training is recommended to promote energy expenditure. Fat utilization occurs during exercise and continues for an extended period of time after the exercise session. The environmental temperatures can influence whole body substrate oxidation. The present study aimed to address the impacts of environmental temperature on fat oxidation during post-exercise recovery in exercise-trained obese women. Eleven sedentary obese women (age: 18-50 y, BMI: 27.5-40 kg/m2) with regular menstruation participated in the study. All subjects underwent a 4-week moderate-intensity aerobic exercise program. After training, each subject completed 2 occasions of post-exercise recovery testing in hot (31-32 °C) and thermo-neutral (22-23 °C) conditions in a randomized crossover fashion with 3-4 days of washout period. Two exercise bouts preceding each recovery condition were identically performed for 60 min at 60 % of heart rate reserve (HRreserve) in the thermo-neutral condition. Both experiments were conducted during the follicular phase of menstrual cycle. Substrate oxidations were determined during 1 h of post-exercise recovery using indirect calorimetry. The results showed that the fat oxidation during recovery in thermo-neutral environment (52.8 ± 26.5 mg.kg-1.h-1) was significantly greater than recovery in hot environment (32.3 ± 27.9 mg.kg-1.h-1, p = 0.0002). Total energy from substrate oxidation was not different between hot and thermo-neutral environments. Thus, in obese women with 4-week exercise training, recovery in the thermo-neutral condition has a higher fat oxidation than in the hot condition. This result may be implicated in weight management for temperature of choice to recover after routine exercise training sessions.']"

For input to the American Meteorological Society/U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Regulatory Model (AERMOD), an hourly continuous vehicle type classified emissions inventory is developed based on local traffic observations and published emissions factors. The simulation accounts for advected-in PM2.5 by hourly measurements from upwind stations. The result reveals a hotspot location near a nearby expressway with PM2.5 concentration peaking at 1-h and 24-h averages of 344 and 130 μg m−3, respectively. Source contribution analysis of the annual average PM2.5 at this hotspot suggests that the expressway contributes approximately 32% of the total PM2.5. Meanwhile, at receptor points farther from the expressway, ground-level urban roads contribute only 17.5% roadside PM2.5 concentrations, the remainder coming from outside the modeled area. A different source contribution breakdown by vehicle type suggests that heavy-duty vehicles contribute up to 21% of annual average PM2.5 at a location near the expressway. At a roadside receptor point farther from the expressway, the top contributors are light-duty (9%) and heavy-duty vehicles (6%). Advected-in PM2.5 dominates the overall PM2.5 concentrations, accounting for 64%–99% depending on the receptor point. The model performance for 24-h average prediction is acceptable.

Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.Particulate matter (PM) is regarded a major problem worldwide because of the harm it causes to human health. Concentrations of PM with particle diameter less than 2.5 µm (PM2.5) and with particle diameter less than 10 µm (PM10) are based on various emission sources as well as meteorological factors. In Bangkok, where the PM2.5 and PM10 monitoring stations are few, the ability to estimate concentrations at any location based on its environment will benefit healthcare policymakers. This research aimed to study the influence of land use, traffic load, and meteorological factors on the PM2.5 and PM10 concentrations in Bangkok using a land-use regression (LUR) approach. The backward stepwise selection method was applied to select the significant variables to be included in the resultant models. Results showed that the adjusted coefficient of determination of the PM2.5 and PM10 LUR models were 0.58 and 0.57, respectively, which are in the same range as reported in the previous studies. The meteorological variables included in both models were rainfall and air pressure; wind speed contributed to only the PM2.5 LUR model. Further, the land-use types selected in the PM2.5 LUR model were industrial and transportation areas. The PM10 LUR model included residential, commercial, industrial, and agricultural areas. Traffic load was excluded from both models. The root mean squared error obtained by 10-fold cross validation was 9.77 and 16.95 for the PM2.5 and PM10 LUR models, respectively.', 'Chemical Composition, Sources, and Health Risk Assessment of PM2.5 and PM10 in Urban Sites of Bangkok, Thailand  2022 by the authors.Of late, air pollution in Asia has increased, particularly in built-up areas due to rapid industrialization and urbanization. The present study sets out to examine the impact that pollution can have on the health of people living in the inner city of Bangkok, Thailand. Consequently, in 2021, fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and coarse particulate matter (PM10) chemical composition and sources are evaluated at three locations in Bangkok. To identify the possible sources of such particulates, therefore, the principal component analysis (PCA) technique is duly carried out. As determined via PCA, the major sources of air pollution in Bangkok are local emission sources and sea salt. The most significant local sources of PM2.5 and PM10 in Bangkok include primary combustion, such as vehicle emissions, coal combustion, biomass burning, secondary aerosol formation, industrial emissions, and dust sources. Except for the hazard quotient (HQ) of Ni and Mn of PM2.5 for adults, the HQ values of As, Cd, Cr, Mn, and Ni of both PM2.5 and PM10 were below the safe level (HQ = 1) for adults and children. This indicates that exposure to these metals would have non-carcinogenic health effects. Except for the carcinogenic risk (HI) value of Cr of PM2.5 and PM10, which can cause cancer in adults, at Bangna and Din Daeng, the HI values of Cd, Ni, As, and Pb of PM2.5 and PM10 are below the limit set by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA).

A 1:2 matched case-control study was performed to evaluate rehospitalization, lung allograft function, and secondary infections up to 90 d after COVID-19 diagnosis (or index dates for controls). Results. Twenty-four LTRs with COVID-19 (cases) and 48 controls were identified. Cases and controls had similar baseline characteristics and lung allograft function. LTRs with COVID-19 had higher incidence of secondary bacterial infection (29.2% versus 6.3%, P = 0.008), readmission (29.2% versus 10.4%, P = 0.04), and for-cause bronchoscopy (33.3% versus 12.5%, P = 0.04) compared with controls. At d 90, mortality in cases versus controls was 8.3% versus 2.1% (P = 0.21), incidence of invasive fungal infections in cases versus controls was 20.8% versus 8.3% (P = 0.13) and forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) decline ≥10% from baseline occurred in 19% of cases versus 12.2% of controls (P = 0.46).

A systematic review and meta-analysis  2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.Background: Cytomegalovirus (CMV) and invasive aspergillosis (IA) cause high morbid-ity and mortality in solid organ transplant (SOT) recipients. There are conflicting data with respect to the impact of CMV on IA development in SOT recipients. Methods: A literature search was con-ducted from existence through to 2 April 2021 using MEDLINE, Embase, and ISI Web of Science databases. This review contained observational studies including cross-sectional, prospective co-hort, retrospective cohort, and case-control studies that reported SOT recipients with post-trans-plant CMV (exposure) and without post-transplant CMV (non-exposure) who developed or did not develop subsequent IA. A random-effects model was used to calculate the pooled effect estimate. Results: A total of 16 studies were included for systematic review and meta-analysis. There were 5437 SOT patients included in the study, with 449 SOT recipients developing post-transplant IA. Post-transplant CMV significantly increased the risk of subsequent IA with pORs of 3.31 (2.34, 4.69), I2 = 30%. Subgroup analyses showed that CMV increased the risk of IA development regardless of the study period (before and after 2003), types of organ transplantation (intra-thoracic and intra-abdominal transplantation), and timing after transplant (early vs. late IA development). Further analyses by CMV definitions showed CMV disease/syndrome increased the risk of IA development, but asymptomatic CMV viremia/infection did not increase the risk of IA. Conclusions: Post-trans-plant CMV, particularly CMV disease/syndrome, significantly increased the risks of IA, which high-lights the importance of CMV prevention strategies in SOT recipients.

Data sources: A systematic literature search was conducted from existence until 11 July 2021 using Medline, Embase and ISI Web of Science databases. Study eligibility criteria: Cross-sectional, prospective cohort, retrospective cohort and case–control studies that reported allo-HSCT recipients with CMV and without CMV who developed or did not develop IFIs after CMV infection. Participants: Allo-HSCT recipients. Interventions: Not applicable. Methods: A systematic search, screening, data extracting and assessing study quality were independently conducted by two reviewers. The Newcastle–Ottawa scale was used to assess risk of bias. data were analysed using the pooled effect estimates of a random-effects model. Results: A total of 18 and 12 studies were included for systematic review and meta-analysis, respectively.

Further subgroup analyses by timing of IFIs, CMV definitions, study continents, study design and adjustment of effect estimates showed that post-transplant CMV infection consistently increased the risk of subsequent IFIs. High-risk CMV serostatus (D–/R+) increased the risk of IFIs with a pooled odds ratio (OR) of 1.33 (1.04, 1.71), I2 = 0%, but low-risk CMV serostatus (D–/R–) decreased the risk of IFIs with a pOR of 0.69 (0.55, 0.87), I2 = 0%. Conclusions: Post-transplant CMV infection and high-risk CMV serostatus increased the risk of IFIs, but low-risk CMV serostatus decreased risk of IFIs among allo-HSCT recipients.

Since mismanaged plastic waste can enter the ocean via inland waterways, microplastic contamination in freshwater used for tap water production has been raised as a potential issue. This study was conducted to determine the abundance and characteristics of microplastics in freshwater and treated tap water in Bangkok. Freshwater and treated water were collected from the eastern and western water supply systems in the dry and wet seasons. The source waters of the eastern and western water supply systems are the Chao Phraya River and Maeklong River, respectively. Approximately 0.40–2.40 particles/L microplastics was determined in the freshwater samples. No significant differences in microplastic abundance with respect to water supply system or season were found. Approximately 82.1% of the total microplastics found in the freshwater were smaller than 300 µm in size. The percentage contribution of various microplastic size ranges decreased with increasing size. The majority of microplastics found in freshwater were fragments (90.2%), colorless (64.3%), and made of polyethylene polymer (45.1%). Only the eastern water supply system was capable of removing microplastic particles (27.7%) from freshwater.

The results revealed that the average total abundance of microplastics (125–5000 µm) was 9.97 pieces/L (1.55 ng/L). Microplastics sized 125–300 µm were most abundant at all the sampling sites, accounting for 68% of the total microplastics. Fiber (35%) and fragment (34%) were the predominant microplastic shapes in the surface water. Polyethylene, polypropylene, and poly(ethylene propylene) accounted for the most prevalent polymer types.

Our study showed a significant, positive correlation between the number of microplastics and land-based sources (e.g., aquatic industries). While human activities were the dominant factor affecting microplastic concentrations, the newly designed surface circulation direction (SCD) index reflected relative changes in microplastic amounts.

Objectives To develop a brief version called the PROMPT, and test its psychometric properties. Setting Four public hospitals in Bangkok, Thailand. Method Secondary analysis of three databases used to develop and evaluate the original PROMPT-QoL. Items for the short-form PROMPT were selected based on expert and patient evaluations of content and importance, and lack of redundancy. All domains of the original version are represented in the PROMPT. Main outcome measures Psychometric properties (internal consistency and test–retest reliability, criterion, convergent and discriminant validity, and responsiveness), and indicators of practicality (e.g., administration time, missing data). Results Analyses of the PROMPT and its domain subscales demonstrated good internal consistency and fair-to-excellent test–retest reliability. Correlations between the original and short-form, overall and by domain, were high. Expectations for convergent and discriminant validity were met as correlations between the PROMPT and generic health-related quality of life measures (WHOQoL-BREF domains and summary scores of the SF-12v2) were modest (< 0.40).

Background: Graves’ ophthalmopathy (GO) is a chronic condition that causes negative self-image and impaired visual function. These conditions impact quality of life (QOL) but are rarely documented. Graves’ Ophthalmopathy Quality of Life Questionnaire (GO-QOL) has good validity, reliability and responsiveness. In this study we developed a Thai GO-QOL questionnaire by translating the questionnaire from English to the Thai language and evaluated its reliability and validity. Patients and methods: Forward and backward translations were performed independently by four translators with extensive experience in both English and Thai. Seventy patients at the thyroid clinic responded to the Thai translated version upon their first visit and again 2–3 weeks afterwards. Validity was assessed by the content validity index (CVI) and correlation with relevant clinical parameters. Reliability was evaluated by Cronbach’s alpha, the intraclass correlation coefficient, and the Bland-Altman plot. Results: The Thai GO-QOL version showed high CVI (0.97) and a moderate negative correlation of the functional QOL score with disease severity (r = − 0.49), the clinical activity score (r = − 0.31), and exposure parameter (r = − 0.32). It showed good reliability with a high intraclass correlation coefficient (0.92) and high Cronbach’ s coefficient (0.86). Conclusion: The Thai GO-QOL has good validity and reliability.

The measure can be used to assess key quality of life domains in individuals from Thailand with chronic low back pain.']"

All rights reserved.Background: Signaling pathways in the STAT4 gene play an essential role in interferon-mediated antiviral effects. Objective: This study was aimed at investigating the role of rs7574865, a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in STAT4, in patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB) treated with pegylated interferon (PEG-IFN). Methods: A total 261 Thai patients (115 HBeAg-positive and 146 HBeAg-negative CHB) treated with 48-week PEG-IFN were recruited. Virological response (VR) at 48 weeks post treatment was defined as HBeAg seroconversion plus HBV DNA < 2,000 IU/mL for HBeAg-positive CHB and HBV DNA < 2,000 IU/mL for HBeAg-negative CHB. The SNP was analyzed by TaqMan PCR assay. Results: The distribution of GG, GT and TT genotypes of rs7574865 was 41.8%, 42.9% and 15.3%, respectively. There was no different in its distribution according to HBeAg status. Overall, patients with TT genotype, compared with non-TT genotype, achieved higher VR (64.3% vs. 30.5%; P < 0.001) and HBsAg clearance (23.8% vs. 5.0%; P < 0.001). There was the same trend in the HBeAg-positive group (VR, 52.4% vs. 30.9%; P = 0.077; HBsAg clearance, 23.8% vs. 6.4%; P = 0.028) and in the HBeAg-negative group (VR, 68.4% vs. 32.3%; P = 0.004; HBsAg clearance, 21.1% vs. 4.7%; P = 0.026). Multiple regression analysis demonstrated that low baseline HBsAg level and TT genotype were factors independently associated with VR and HBsAg clearance. Conclusions: Our data support that SNP rs7574865 is associated with response to PEG-IFN therapy in Thai patients with CHB, regardless of baseline HBeAg status. Thus, the determination of this SNP could maximize cost-effectiveness of PEG-IFN in patients with CHB.', 'Predictive role of serum HBsAg and HBcrAg kinetics in patients with HBeAg-negative chronic hepatitis B receiving pegylated interferon–based therapy  2017 European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious DiseasesObjectives: To investigate the role of serum hepatitis B core-related antigen (HBcrAg) kinetics in predicting long-term outcome of pegylated interferon (PEG-IFN)-based therapy in patients with hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg)-negative chronic hepatitis B (CHB). Methods: A total of 121 Thai patients with HBeAg-negative CHB recruited from a previous randomized trial of 48-week PEG-IFN alone or combined with entecavir were enrolled. Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and HBcrAg levels were serially examined. Paired biopsy samples taken at baseline and after treatment were assessed for intrahepatic covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA). Results: Persistent virologic remission (PVR, defined by persistent hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA <2000 IU/mL) and HBsAg clearance at 3 years after treatment were 29% (35/121) and 9% (11/121) respectively. Baseline HBcrAg correlated with HBV DNA and cccDNA but not with HBsAg. Baseline HBsAg, as well as HBsAg and HBcrAg, declines were associated with PVR, while HBsAg decline was predictive of HBsAg clearance. High baseline antigen levels (HBsAg ≥3.4 log10 IU/mL plus HBcrAg ≥3.7 log10 U/mL) yielded high negative predictive values of PVR (45/50, 90%) and HBsAg clearance (50/50, 100%). At week 12, declines of HBsAg, HBcrAg and both antigens combined of <0.5 log10 yielded negative predictive values for PVR of 90% (71/79), 82% (61/74) and 96% (48/50) respectively. Conclusions: Quantitative HBcrAg was significantly associated with cccDNA in HBeAg-negative CHB. This novel antigen, together with HBsAg, could identify patients with low probability of PVR and HBsAg clearance in long-term follow-up.', 'Baseline and kinetics of serum hepatitis B virus RNA predict response to pegylated interferon-based therapy in patients with hepatitis B e antigen-negative chronic hepatitis B  2019 John Wiley & Sons LtdSerum hepatitis B virus (HBV) RNA has emerged as a novel biomarker of treatment response. This study aimed to investigate the role of this marker in predicting long-term outcome of patients with hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg)-negative chronic hepatitis B (CHB) receiving pegylated interferon (PEG-IFN)-based therapy. Serial serum samples from 91 patients with HBeAg-negative CHB previously treated with PEG-IFN alone or combined with entecavir in a randomized trial were retrospectively analysed. HBV RNA quantification was examined by droplet digital PCR. At the end of 3 years post-treatment follow-up, maintained virological response (MVR, HBV DNA < 2000 IU/mL), and hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) clearance were achieved in 37.4% (34/91) and 7.7% (7/91), respectively. Baseline serum HBV RNA concentrations correlated with HBV DNA and covalently closed circular DNA but did not correlate with HBsAg levels. Multiple regression analysis showed that pre-treatment HBV RNA and HBsAg were independently associated with MVR and HBsAg clearance. Baseline HBV RNA (cut-off 2.0 log10 copies/mL) had a positive predictive value (PPV) and a negative predictive value in predicting MVR of 80.8% and 80.0%, respectively. At the same cut-off value, PPV and NPV for predicting HBsAg clearance were 30.8% and 95.4%, respectively. At week 12 during therapy, HBV RNA level ≥ 2 log10 copies/mL displayed high NPVs of achieving MVR and HBsAg clearance (95% and 100%, respectively). In conclusion, the measurement of HBV RNA prior to PEG-IFN-based therapy could identify patients with high probability of MVR. In addition, HBV RNA kinetics may serve as a promising “stopping rule” in patients infected with HBV genotypes B or C.']"

Among natural CDs, γ-cyclodextrin (γCD) has the highest water solubility, largest cavity size, and most favorable toxicological profile. γCD can form inclusion complexes with a wide variety of drugs. In aqueous solution, γCD tends to self-assemble to form aggregates, leading to formation of both nano- and microparticles. The self-assembled γCD molecules can increase the solubility and enhance drug permeability through biological membranes, consequently improving drug bioavailability. This promising drug delivery platform is well tolerated, and it has low ocular toxicity. Clinical studies have shown that this nanocarrier can enhance topical drug delivery to both the anterior and posterior segment of the eye. The present article reviews the physicochemical properties of γCD and its derivatives, their toxicological profiles, the γCD solubilization of drugs, and methods for enhancing drug/γCD complexes and their aggregates. Additionally, examples of self-assembled drug/γCD complexes in ophthalmic preparations are discussed.', 'Aqueous solubility of kinase inhibitors: I the effect of hydrophilic polymers on their γ-cyclodextrin solubilization  2019 Elsevier B.V.Most small-molecule protein kinase inhibitors (KIs) are neutral or weakly basic lipophilic compounds with very poor solubility in aqueous media that decreases their ability to permeate biological membranes from an aqueous exterior and consequently bestow them with low bioavailability after oral and topical administration. Cyclodextrin (CD) complexation can increase water-solubility of poorly soluble drugs without affecting their ability to permeate biological membranes. The aim of the present study was to enhance aqueous solubility of six KIs that is axitinib, cediranib, dovitinib, motesanib, pazopanib and regorafenib, through formation of drug/γ-cyclodextrin (γCD)/polymer ternary complexes. The complexes were prepared in an aqueous environment by heating technique. The phase-solubility profiles showed formation of binary KI/γCD complexes of Bs-type. γCD alone had significant solubilizing effect on dovitinib (stability constant (K1:1) = 684 M−1 and complexation efficacy (CE) = 0.011). The aqueous solubility of the binary KI/γCD complexes was pH-dependent. Hexadimethrine bromide (HDMBr) was the most effective polymer of the ones tested. The ternary complexes formed nano-sized aggregates with diameter between 200 and 400 nm. Osmolarity and pH were also monitored. TEM study showed formation of complex aggregates in aqueous media.', 'Effect of salt formation on γ-cyclodextrin solubilization of irbesartan and candesartan and the chemical stability of their ternary complexes  2021 Elsevier B.V.Angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) are unstable compounds and have relatively low aqueous solubility, which may hamper their bioavailability. The present study aimed to increase the aqueous solubility of ARBs by the formation of cyclodextrin (CD) inclusion complex and determine their chemical stability in aqueous solutions. The pH- solubility of drugs and their phase-solubility profiles were determined, and the results showed that the solubility of drugs increased by forming inclusion complexes with γ-cyclodextrin (γCD) and by increasing their intrinsic solubility in phosphate buffer (pH 7.5). The formation of irbesartan/γCD (IRB/γCD) and candesartan cilexetil/γCD (CAC/γCD) inclusion complexes was confirmed by molecular docking. To enhance the γCD solubilization of drugs, salt formation using various organic salts was also investigated. Of these, Tris was the most powerful, followed by sodium acetate, as they significantly increased the γCD solubilization of IRB and CAC. However, chemical instability was observed, particularly at high salt concentrations, where they provided a higher IRB and CAC solubility. Thus, the balance of optimum drug solubility and its chemical stability in aqueous solutions should be considered in formulation development.']"

Various factors like the effects of initial concentration, contact time, and influence of pH were investigated. Selective adsorption experiments in connection with coexisting ions and dissolved organic matter (DOM) were also investigated. In this study, humic acid (HA) and tannic acid (TA) were representative of both hydrophobic and hydrophilic DOM, respectively. Results indicated that A-mGO-Si had an adsorption ability for OTC that was relatively greater than that of virgin magnetic graphene oxide (mGO), graphene oxide (GO), Fe3O4 particles, and SBA-15 mesoporous silica and also showed a better uptake removal capacity for OTC at low initial concentration in comparison with the other adsorbents. The adsorption behavior of OTC onto A-mGO-Si could be described by the pseudo-second-order kinetic model and the Freundlich isotherm model. The electrostatic interaction has no influence on the OTC absorbed when the OTC is in an aqueous medium in its zwitterion form (3.22 < pH < 7.46). At high pH, the weak π–π EDA interactions and hydrogen bonding may manifest themselves, hence causing a lower adsorption capacity. The main adsorption mechanisms were plausibly activated by H-bonding, and π–π EDA interactions, while the electrostatic interaction (cation–π interaction) might be the minor adsorption mechanism. Addition of individually exogenous ions (Na+, Mg2+, NO−, and CO3 2−) resulted in a decrease of OTC adsorption due to the emergence of a competitive effect. Considering the presence of HA and TA in mixed solute systems, the DOM was likely to form a stronger interaction system with mGO-Si, thereby resulting in an adsorption level which was more competitive in the process at low aqueous phase concentration of OTC. In contrast to the high aqueous phase, the coexistence of DOM could promote OTC adsorption. The phenomenon may reflect the result that a surface complexation mechanism could achieve in adsorptions.', 'Adsorption removal of methylene blue onto activated carbon/cellulose biocomposite films: Equilibrium and kinetic studies  2019 Elsevier B.V.Activated carbon/cellulose composite (ACC) biosorbent films were fabricated via solution casting by combining 1–3% w/v of activated carbon with the cellulose solution which dissolved by lithium chloride/N, N-dimethylacetamide. Both cellulose solution and activated carbon were prepared from sisal fiber. These films were characterized by scanning electron microscope (SEM), Fourier transform infrared spectroscope (FTIR), thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA), and X-ray Diffractometer (XRD). The specific surface area of activated carbon was found to be 1165 m2/g. The maximum methylene blue adsorption capacity of the ACC film reached 103.66 mg/g with the dye concentration of 100 mg/L, solution pH of 6.9, at 35○C for 24 h. The adsorption data suggested that the isotherm model for the equilibrium process was that of Langmuir model, and the adsorption kinetic was best described by pseudo-second-order model. The effect of initial dye concentration (20–100 mg/L), contact time (0–2,880 min), pH (3–11), and temperature (35–80○C) on adsorption capacity of ACC3 film were also examined. Thermodynamics studies of ACC3 film revealed that the adsorption process was endothermic, spontaneous, and feasible. Therefore, the activated carbon/cellulose composite films can be potentially used as biosorbents to remove dyes from contaminated water.', 'Synthesis and characterization of Cu(OH)2-NWs-PVA-AC Nano-composite and its use as an efficient adsorbent for removal of methylene blue  2021, The Author(s).The present study focused on the synthesis of copper hydroxide nanowires decorated on activated carbon (Cu(OH)2-NWs-PVA-AC). The obtained Cu(OH)2-NWs-PVA-AC Nano-composite was distinguished by XRD, SEM, EDX, BET, FTIR and XPS respectively. Besides, different variables such as solution pH, and initial dye concentration, contact time, and temperature were performed on the adsorption efficiency of MB in a small batch reactor. Further, the experimental results are analyzed by various kinetic models via PFO, PSO, intra-particle diffusion and Elovich models, and the results revealed that among the kinetic models, PSO shows more suitability. In addition, different adsorption isotherms were applied to the obtained experimental data and found that Langmuir–Freundlich and Langmuir isotherm were best fits with the maximum adsorption capacity of 139.9 and 107.6 mg/g, respectively. The Nano-composite has outstanding MB removal efficiency of 94–98.5% with a span of 10 min. and decent adsorption of about 98.5% at a pH of 10. Thermodynamic constants like Gibbs free energy, entropy, and enthalpy were analyzed from the temperature reliance. The results reveal the adsorption processes are spontaneous and exothermic in nature. The high negative value of ΔG° (− 44.11 to − 48.86 kJ/mol) and a low negative value of ΔH° (− 28.96 kJ/mol) show the feasibility and exothermic nature of the adsorption process. The synthesized dye was found to be an efficient adsorbent for the potential removal of cationic dye (methylene blue) from wastewater within a short time.']"

Usage and distribution for commercial purposes requires written permission.The prevalence of obesity is increasing, and the coexistence of obesity and systemic lupus erythematosus (lupus) is possible. A high-fat diet (HFD) was orally administered for 6 months in female 8-week-old Fc gamma receptor IIb deficient (FcgRIIb-/-) lupus or age and gender-matched wild-type (WT) mice. Lupus nephritis (anti-dsDNA, proteinuria, and increased creatinine), gut barrier defect (fluorescein isothiocyanate dextran), serum lipopolysaccharide (LPS), serum interleukin (IL)-6, liver injury (alanine transaminase), organ fibrosis (liver and kidney pathology), spleen apoptosis (activated caspase 3), and aorta thickness (but not weight gain and lipid profiles) were more prominent in HFD-administered FcgRIIb-/- mice than the obese WT, without injury in regular diet-administered mice (both FcgRIIb-/- and WT). In parallel, combined palmitic acid (PA; a saturated fatty acid) with LPS (PA + LPS) induced higher tumor necrotic factor-α, IL-6, and IL-10 in the supernatant, inflammatory genes (inducible nitric oxide synthase and IL-1β), reactive oxygen species (dihydroethidium), and glycolysis with reduced mitochondrial activity (extracellular flux analysis) when compared with the activation by each molecule alone in both FcgRIIb-/- and WT macrophages. However, the alterations of these parameters were more prominent in PA + LPS-administered FcgRIIb-/- than in the WT cells. In conclusion, obesity accelerated inflammation in FcgRIIb-/- mice, partly due to the more potent responses from the loss of inhibitory FcgRIIb against PA + LPS with obesity-induced gut barrier defect.', 'Leaky-gut enhanced lupus progression in the Fc gamma receptor-IIb deficient and pristane-induced mouse models of lupus  2020, The Author(s).The influence of gut-leakage or gut-microbiota upon lupus progression was explored in 2 lupus mouse models. Pristane, administered in 4-wk-old wild-type (WT) female mice, induced lupus characteristics at 24-wk-old similar to the lupus-onset in FcGRIIb−/− mice. Gut-microbiota alteration was induced by co-housing together with the gavage of feces from 40-wk-old FcGRIIb−/− mice (symptomatic lupus). On the other hand, gut-leakage was induced by dextran sulfate solution (DSS). DSS and gut-microbiota alteration induced high serum anti-dsDNA immunoglobulin (Ig) as early as 30 days post-DSS only in FcGRIIb−/− mice. DSS, but not gut-microbiota alteration, enhanced lupus characteristics (serum creatinine and proteinuria) in both lupus models (but not in WT) at 60 days post-DSS. Indeed, DSS induced the translocation of molecular components of gut-pathogens as determined by bacterial burdens in mesenteric lymph node (MLN), endotoxemia (gut-bacterial molecule) and serum (1→3)-β-D-glucan (BG) (gut-fungal molecule) as early as 15 days post-DSS together with enhanced MLN apoptosis in both WT and lupus mice. However, DSS induced spleen apoptosis in FcGRIIb−/− and WT mice at 30 and 60 days post-DSS, respectively, suggesting the higher impact of gut-leakage against spleen of lupus mice. In addition, macrophages preconditioning with LPS plus BG were susceptible to starvation-induced apoptosis, predominantly in FcGRIIb−/− cell, implying the influence of gut-leakage upon cell stress. In summary, gut-leakage induced gut-translocation of organismal-molecules then enhanced the susceptibility of stress-induced apoptosis, predominantly in lupus. Subsequently, the higher burdens of apoptosis in lupus mice increased anti-dsDNA Ig and worsen lupus severity through immune complex deposition. Hence, therapeutic strategies addressing gut-leakage in lupus are interesting.', 'Prominent indomethacin-induced enteropathy in fcgriib defi-cient lupus mice: an impact of macrophage responses and immune deposition in gut  2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.A high dose of NSAIDs, a common analgesic, might induce lupus activity through several NSAIDs adverse effects including gastrointestinal permeability defect (gut leakage) and endotoxemia. Indomethacin (25 mg/day) was orally administered for 7 days in 24-wk-old Fc gamma receptor IIb deficient (FcgRIIb-/-) mice, an asymptomatic lupus model (increased anti-dsDNA without lupus nephritis), and age-matched wild-type (WT) mice. Severity of indomethacin-induced enteropathy in FcgRIIb-/-mice was higher than WT mice as demonstrated by survival analysis, intestinal injury (histology, immune-deposition, and intestinal cytokines), gut leakage (FITC-dextran assay and endotoxemia), serum cytokines, and lupus characteristics (anti-dsDNA, renal injury, and proteinuria). Prominent responses of FcgRIIb-/-macrophages toward lipopolysaccharide (LPS) compared to WT cells due to the expression of only activating-FcgRs without inhibitory-FcgRIIb were demonstrated. Extracellular flux analysis indicated the greater mitochondria activity (increased respiratory capacity and respiratory reserve) in FcgRIIb-/-macrophages with a concordant decrease in glycolysis activity when compared to WT cells. In conclusion, gut leakage-induced endotoxemia is more severe in indomethacin-administered FcgRIIb-/-mice than WT, possibly due to the enhanced indomethacin toxicity from lupus-induced intestinal immune-deposition. Due to a lack of inhibitory-FcgRIIb expression, mitochondrial function, and cytokine production of FcgRIIb-/-macrophages were more prominent than WT cells. Hence, lupus disease-activation from NSAIDs-enteropathy-induced gut leakage is possible.']"

However, their potential role as a connective mode for mass transit systems is often overlooked. This study verifies the hypothesis that, due to the lack of guidance or planning by the government, paratransit services have been driven by market mechanisms to concentrate in areas closer to mass transit stations and other centers of economic activity, including markets. We tested this hypothesis with a negative binomial regression using data on motorcycle taxi services in Bangkok, as a case study. Motorcycle taxis mostly operate as a group, known as a win in Thai, waiting for passengers at certain places, including mass transit stations. Location data on 821 wins were randomly collected from 144 grid zones (= 144 km 2 ) through Google Maps between July 24 and August 24, 2017. Win density was defined as the number of wins in each one-square-kilometer zone. The results showed that win density increased by 4.4% and 25.1% in zones that were 1 km closer to transit stations and markets, respectively, all else being held constant; this confirmed the hypothesis. Policy implications are discussed along with the recent penetration of ride-hailing services in the paratransit market.', 'Car versus motorcycle ride-hailing applications: User behaviors and adoption factors in Bangkok, Thailand  2023 World Conference on Transport Research SocietyRide-hailing applications (RHA) have surged in popularity in Southeast Asia, yet research comparing car and motorcycle RHA user characteristics, trip behaviors, and factors influencing adoption remain limited. To fill this gap, this study investigated motorcycle RHA use individually and in conjunction with use of car RHA by using the bivariate probit regression to analyze traveler intercept survey data from Bangkok, Thailand. Our findings revealed that car RHA has a higher market penetration rate than motorcycle RHA but that motorcycle RHA is used more frequently. Motorcycle RHA was adopted and used more frequently by individuals who have access to a private car and reside in areas with high urban rail accessibility. Notably, motorcycle RHA was used to connect to urban rail significantly more than car RHA, illustrating the need for policies that facilitate the connective role of motorcycle RHA in accessing public transportation. Overall, our results support the synergy hypothesis between car and motorcycle RHA based on the highly significant correlation between the two modes in the bivariate probit models.', ""Motorcycle taxis' varying degrees of complementarity and substitution with public transit in Bangkok  2023 The AuthorsMotorcycle taxis are widely used in Bangkok, Thailand and across the Global South due to wide availability, low investment costs to owners, and low fares for passengers. Our study using Bangkok as a case study investigates the role of motorcycle taxis in relationship to public transit, determining if the role of motorcycle taxis could vary across different areas instead of being solely either complementary or substitute. Recent studies on motorcycle taxis have taken an overly broad approach that covers large geographical areas. Most provided a definite one-or-the-other answer, concluding that motorcycle taxis either complement or substitute for public transit. By contrast, our research shows evidence of their adaptive role when looking at smaller areas, where the roles of motorcycle taxis vis-à-vis rail and bus transit change according to locational and spatial characteristics. We use the number of registered motorcycle taxi drivers as a proxy for supply in 180 subdistricts of Bangkok, which were classified into three groups: central business district (CBD) subdistrict, inner suburban subdistrict, and outer suburban subdistrict. Using spatial autoregressive model (SAR) modeling, we found that in outer suburban subdistricts, for every additional transit station, there are 177 more motorcycle taxi drivers. Yet in CBD subdistricts, motorcycle taxi is lowest complementary to rail transit and for every additional bus stop in a CBD subdistrict, there are 10 more motorcycle taxi drivers. This suggests the degree of complementarity between motorcycle taxis and public transit varies with different locational and spatial contexts and transit types. With the findings of adaptive roles of motorcycle taxis depending on land use, transit availability, and activity patterns in each area, policymakers should consider appropriate policies and regulations based on these roles in relation to public transport.""]"

Published by Oxford University Press for the Infectious Diseases Society of America. All rights reserved.Background. The blunting effect of pertussis immunization during pregnancy on infant antibody responses induced by whole-cell pertussis (wP) vaccination is not well-defined. Methods. This randomized controlled trial (NCT02408926) followed term infants born to mothers vaccinated with tetanus, diphtheria, and acellular pertussis (Tdap) vaccine during pregnancy in Thailand. Infants received either acellular pertussis (aP)- or wP-containing vaccine at 2, 4, 6, and 18 months of age. A comparison group comprised wP-vaccinated children born to mothers not vaccinated during pregnancy. Antibodies against pertussis toxin (PT), filamentous hemagglutinin (FHA), and pertactin (PRN) were evaluated using commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Functionality of antibodies against Bordetella pertussis was measured using Bordetella pertussis growth inhibition assay. Results. After maternal Tdap vaccination, 158 infants vaccinated with aP-containing vaccines possessed higher antibody levels (P <.001) against all tested B. pertussis antigens postpriming compared to 157 infants receiving wP-containing vaccines. At 1 month postbooster, only anti-FHA and anti-PRN antibodies were still significantly higher (P <.001) in the aP group. Significantly higher anti-PT and anti-FHA (P <.001), but not anti-PRN immunoglobulin G, were observed among 69 wP-vaccinated infants born to control mothers compared with wP-vaccinated infants of Tdap-vaccinated mothers after primary and booster vaccination. The antibody functionality was higher in all wP-vaccinated infants at all times. Conclusions. Maternal Tdap vaccination inhibited more pertussis-specific responses in wP-vaccinated infants compared to aP-vaccinated infants, and the control group of unvaccinated women had highest PT-specific responses, persisting until after the booster dose. Antibody functionality was better in the wP groups.', 'Assessing the reactogenicity of Tdap vaccine administered during pregnancy and antibodies to Bordetella pertussis antigens in maternal and cord sera of Thai women  2018 Elsevier LtdIntroduction: Pregnant Thai women have low antibody titers against B. pertussis antigens, which coincide with an increasing incidence of pertussis among Thai infants. Thus, there exists a potential benefit of a booster dose of tetanus- diphtheria-acellular pertussis (Tdap) vaccine administered during pregnancy. Here, we report the vaccine reactogenicity profile and birth outcomes in Tdap-vaccinated pregnant women who have or have not had prior immunization with tetanus vaccine, and the IgG levels to B. pertussis antigens in maternal and cord sera at delivery. Materials and methods: Pregnant women (N = 370) aged 18–40 years were administered the Tdap vaccine (Boostrix® GlaxoSmithKline, Rixensart, Belgium) at 26–36 weeks gestation. Adverse events following vaccination were identified by follow-up telephone call and medical record review. IgG against pertussis toxin (anti-PT), filamentous hemagglutinin (anti-FHA) and pertactin (anti-PRN) in both maternal and umbilical cord blood obtained at delivery were quantitatively evaluated using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (EUROIMMUN® Lübeck, Germany). Results: There was no reported increase in the severity or duration of adverse events associated with the administration of an extra tetanus-containing vaccine within the previous five years (N = 181) or multiple doses of tetanus-containing vaccines during the current pregnancy (N = 98). Vaccination at least eight weeks prior to delivery resulted in high antibody titers to all B. pertussis antigens studied. Conclusions: The reactogenicity of Tdap vaccine administered during pregnancy was not affected by prior tetanus toxoid immunization. High transplacental antibody against B. pertussis antigens in the cord blood provides evidence of antibody transfer and should thus help to protect newborns from pertussis during early life.']"

Microalgae have been proposed as a suitable biological platform to reduce carbon dioxide, a major greenhouse gas, while also creating commercial sources of high-value compounds such as medicines, cosmetics, food, feed, and biofuel. Industrialization of microalgae culture and valorization is still limited by significant challenges in scaling up the production processes due to economic constraints and productivity capacities. Therefore, a boost in resource usage efficiency is required. This enhancement not only lowers manufacturing costs but also enhancing the long-term viability of microalgae-based products. Using wastewater as a nutrient source is a great way to reduce manufacturing costs. Furthermore, water scarcity is one of the most important global challenges. In recent decades, industrialization, globalization, and population growth have all impacted freshwater resources. Moreover, high amounts of organic and inorganic toxins in the water due to the disposal of waste into rivers can have severe impacts on human and animal health. Microalgae cultures are a sustainable solution to tertiary and quaternary treatments since they have the ability to digest complex contaminants. This review presents biorefineries based on microalgae from all angles, including the potential for environmental pollution remediation as well as applications for bioenergy and value-added biomolecule production. An overview of current information about microalgae-based technology and a discussion of the associated hazards and opportunities for the bioeconomy are highlighted.', 'Microalgae cultivation in wastewater and potential processing strategies using solvent and membrane separation technologies  2020 Elsevier LtdMicroalgae has been utilised in various applications ranging from pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, supplements, liquid fuels as well as food source for human and animals. The upscaling of microalgae production to meet the demand for global consumption has yet to be realized as there are many factors to be considered in the upstream and downstream processing of microalgae biomass. For upstream processing, the high cultivation cost which poses a major setback can be reduced by cultivating the microalgae in wastewater sources, which are widely available and at the same time can lead to bioremediation of these waste sources. The contents of microalgae biomass from wastewater can also be used to produce the desired bioproducts. For downstream processing, the efficiency of traditional processes has long hindered the progression of microalgae to products, hence, the discovery of advanced technologies which can yield higher productivity and good quality products have been studied and upscale to a pilot scale to verify its feasibility. Separation techniques like liquid biphasic system and membrane separation are potential in achieving high yield and separation efficiency to recover valuable products from microalgae and these processes are environmentally friendly and cost-effective. The insights from cultivating microalgae in wastewater sources and the promising technologies to convert them into useful bioproducts will be beneficial to the developments of future upstream and downstream processes.', 'Microalgal Biorefinery Concepts’ Developments for Biofuel and Bioproducts: Current Perspective and Bottlenecks  2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.Microalgae have received much interest as a biofuel feedstock. However, the economic feasibility of biofuel production from microalgae does not satisfy capital investors. Apart from the biofuels, it is necessary to produce high-value co-products from microalgae fraction to satisfy the economic aspects of microalgae biorefinery. In addition, microalgae-based wastewater treatment is considered as an alternative for the conventional wastewater treatment in terms of energy con-sumption, which is suitable for microalgae biorefinery approaches. The energy consumption of a microalgae wastewater treatment system (0.2 kW/h/m3 ) was reduced 10 times when compared to the conventional wastewater treatment system (to 2 kW/h/m3 ). Microalgae are rich in various biomolecules such as carbohydrates, proteins, lipids, pigments, vitamins, and antioxidants; all these valuable products can be utilized by nutritional, pharmaceutical, and cosmetic industries. There are several bottlenecks associated with microalgae biorefinery. Hence, it is essential to promote the sustainability of microalgal biorefinery with innovative ideas to produce biofuel with high-value products. This review attempted to bring out the trends and promising solutions to realize microalgal production of multiple products at an industrial scale. New perspectives and current challenges are discussed for the development of algal biorefinery concepts.']"

Little is known about the disease burden in Laos. We aimed to evaluate the burden and outcomes of AKI as well as assess the availability of AKI treatment in Laos. Methods: We performed a multicentric prospective observational study in adult patients who had been admitted to 5 intensive care units (ICU) in Laos. The data was serially collected on the first 28 days of ICU admission. Patients were diagnosed by the KDIGO 2012 criteria for AKI. We used AKI occurrence as the primary outcome and explored risk factors on the development and outcomes of AKI. Results: We enrolled 1480 patients from 5 ICU centers across Laos from January to December 2016. After excluding patients with end-stage renal disease and those with incomplete data, AKI occurred in 508 of the 1460 enrolled patients (34.8%). Overall, the rates of maximum AKI staging were 4% for stage 1, 10.3% for stage 2, and 20.5% for stage 3. Risk factors for AKI were older age, obesity, cardiovascular diseases, respiratory diseases, renal diseases, oncologic diseases, and chronic kidney diseases. Only 1.8% of all participants received RRT. The mortality rate was 28.4% in non-AKI patients compared to 44.5% in AKI patients, which increased according to the stage of AKI (stage 1, 4.9%; stage 2, 28.3%; stage 3 66.8%; P < 0.001).

We aimed to describe the prevalence and risk factors for development of AKI, its subsequent clinical course and AKI progression, as well as renal recovery or dialysis dependence and survival in this group of patients. Methods: This was a retrospective observational study in an expanded tertiary care intensive care unit in London, United Kingdom. Critically ill patients admitted to ICU between 1st March 2020 and 31st July 2020 with confirmed SARS-COV2 infection were included. Analysis of baseline characteristics, organ support, COVID-19 associated therapies and their association with mortality and outcomes at 90 days was performed. Results: Of 313 patients (70% male, mean age 54.5 ± 13.9 years), 240 (76.7%) developed AKI within 14 days after ICU admission: 63 (20.1%) stage 1, 41 (13.1%) stage 2, 136 (43.5%) stage 3. 113 (36.1%) patients presented with AKI on ICU admission. Progression to AKI stage 2/3 occurred in 36%. Risk factors for AKI progression were mechanical ventilation [HR (hazard ratio) 4.11; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.61–10.49] and positive fluid balance [HR 1.21 (95% CI 1.11–1.31)], while steroid therapy was associated with a reduction in AKI progression (HR 0.73 [95% CI 0.55–0.97]). Kidney replacement therapy (KRT) was initiated in 31.9%. AKI patients had a higher 90-day mortality than non-AKI patients (34% vs. 14%; p < 0.001). Dialysis dependence was 5% at hospital discharge and 4% at 90 days. Renal recovery was identified in 81.6% of survivors at discharge and in 90.9% at 90 days. At 3 months, 16% of all AKI survivors had chronic kidney disease (CKD); among those without renal recovery, the CKD incidence was 44%. Conclusions: During the first COVID-19 wave, AKI was highly prevalent among severely ill COVID-19 patients with a third progressing to severe AKI requiring KRT. The risk of developing CKD was high. This study identifies factors modifying AKI progression, including a potentially protective effect of steroid therapy.

The participants were categorized into AKI and non-AKI groups. The participants were further classified according to the 3 different stages of AKI as per the Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcome (KDIGO) criteria. Results: Overall incidence of AKI was 43%. The participants were divided into three groups based on the AKI stages: 18.5% had stage 1, 33% had stage 2, and 48.5% had stage 3.

Chronic kidney disease was the risk factor for severe AKI. Sepsis was the leading cause of AKI. Among the AKI participants, 24.6% required RRT. The most common RRT modalities were intermittent hemodialysis (71.7%), followed by slow low-efficiency dialysis (22.8%), continuous renal replacement therapy (4.3%), and peritoneal dialysis (1.1%). Conclusions: This study showed that AKI was a common problem in the Indonesian ICU. We strongly believe that identification of the risk factors associated with AKI will help us develop a predictive score for AKI so we can prevent and improve AKI outcome in the future.']"

The clinical use of a platelet-rich plasma (PRP) injection is an alternative treatment method for the condition, despite the paucity of evidence of its efficacy. Purpose: To compare pain relief, functional improvement, and complications after an intratendinous PRP injection versus a subacromial corticosteroid injection for partial supraspinatus tears. Study Design: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 1. Methods: A total of 32 patients with partial supraspinatus tears were randomly assigned to receive a leukocyte-poor PRP (LP-PRP) injection or a corticosteroid injection. One patient withdrew from the PRP group, leaving 15 patients in the PRP group and 16 patients in the corticosteroid group. The ultrasound-guided procedures were performed by a single experienced pain physician. Pain relief and functional improvement were evaluated using the visual analog scale (VAS) and the Oxford Shoulder Score (OSS), respectively. Treatment efficacy and complications were documented, and the 2 groups were compared at 1- and 6-month follow-up. Results: There were no differences in VAS and OSS scores between the PRP and corticosteroid groups at 1-month follow-up. However, the PRP group had better scores than the corticosteroid group had on both the VAS and OSS at 6-month follow-up (VAS: 14.5 ± 15.4 vs 37.5 ± 24.9, respectively; OSS: 16.2 ± 3.9 vs 25.0 ± 10.2, respectively; P <.01 for both). Both groups showed significant improvement in VAS and OSS scores from before treatment to 1-month follow-up (mean difference, 35.67 and 11.47 points, respectively, for the PRP group; mean difference, 29.69 and 11.13 points, respectively, for the corticosteroid group; P <.01 for all).

However, this could result in unwanted side effects, such as tendon rupture. Alternatively, platelet-rich plasma (PRP) injection is frequently used to treat tendinopathies because it enhances healing. This study aimed to compare the differences in tear size and functional scores between intralesional PRP and subacromial CS injections. Methods: Patients with symptomatic partial-thickness tears of the supraspinatus tendon who underwent conservative treatment for ≥ 3 months were enrolled. All patients underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to confirm the diagnosis. Fourteen and 15 patients were randomized to receive intralesional PRP and subacromial CS injections, respectively. Tears were measured in the coronal and sagittal planes. The patients underwent another MRI 6 months after the injection. Tear size was compared between the two MRI results. The American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons Shoulder score (ASES) and Constant–Murley score (CMS) were also obtained. Results: The baseline data were similar between the groups. In the coronal plane, PRP and CS showed tear size reductions of 3.39 mm (P = 0.003) and 1.10 mm (P = 0.18), respectively. In the sagittal plane, PRP and CS showed tear size reductions of 2.97 mm (P = 0.001) and 0.76 mm (P = 0.29), respectively. Functional scores improved 6 months after injection in both groups, but PRP showed better functional scores than CS (P = 0.002 for ASES, P = 0.02 for CS). Conclusion: Intralesional PRP injection can reduce the tear size in partial-thickness tears of the supraspinatus tendon. Subacromial steroid injection did not significantly affect the tear size.

However, the therapeutic efficacy of curcumin is limited by its poor physicochemical properties. The present study aimed to develop a new carrier-linked curcumin prodrug, curcumin diethyl γ-aminobutyrate (CUR-2GE), with improved physicochemical and anti-neuroinflammatory properties. CUR-2GE was designed and synthesized by conjugating curcumin with gamma-aminobutyric acid ethyl ester (GE) via a carbamate linkage. The carbamate linkage was selected to increase stability at acidic pH while GE served as a promoiety for lipophilic enhancement. The synthesized CUR-2GE was investigated for solubility, partition coefficient, stability, and bioconversion. The solubility of CUR-2GE was less than 0.05 μg/mL similar to that of curcumin, while the lipophilicity with log P of 3.57 was significantly increased. CUR-2GE was resistant to chemical hydrolysis at acidic pH (pH 1.2 and 4.5) as anticipated but rapidly hydrolyzed at pH 6.8 and 7.4. The incomplete hydrolysis of CUR-2GE was observed in simulated gastrointestinal fluids which liberated the intermediate curcumin monoethyl γ-aminobutyric acid (CUR-1GE) and the parent curcumin. In plasma, CUR-2GE was sequentially converted to CUR-1GE and curcumin within 1 h. In lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated BV-2 microglial cells, CUR-2GE effectively attenuated the proinflammatory mediators by decreasing the secretion of nitric oxide and cytokines (TNF-α and IL-6) to a greater extent than curcumin due to an increase in cellular uptake. Altogether, the newly developed acid-stable CUR-2GE prodrug is a potential pre-clinical and clinical candidate for further evaluation on neuroprotective and anti-neuroinflammatory effects."", 'Curcumin Diethyl γ-Aminobutyrate, a Prodrug of Curcumin, for Enhanced Treatment of Inflammatory Pain  2022 American Chemical Society.

Despite its potential, curcumin exhibits poor physicochemical and pharmacokinetic properties, which hinder its oral therapeutic efficacy. Curcumin diethyl γ-aminobutyrate (CUR-2GE), a carbamate prodrug of curcumin, was designed to overcome these limitations and demonstrated greater anti-neuroinflammatory effects compared to curcumin in vitro. Thus, this study evaluated the effect of CUR-2GE and its parent compound on pain-like behaviors in carrageenan- and LPS-induced mouse models. The possible side effects of CUR-2GE were also assessed by exploring its effects on motor coordination and spontaneous locomotor activity after acute and chronic treatments. The results showed that CUR-2GE improved mechanical and thermal hyperalgesia and locomotor activity to a greater extent than curcumin in carrageenan-induced mice. These results are in line with the ability of CUR-2GE to suppress peripheral inflammation in the paw tissue of carrageenan-induced mice, indicated by a significant decrease in TNF-α and IL-6 expression levels. Similarly, in LPS-induced mice, CUR-2GE improved sickness and pain-like behaviors (exploratory behaviors and long-term locomotor activity) to a greater extent than curcumin. Furthermore, CUR-2GE significantly reduced the level of proinflammatory cytokines in both the plasma and spinal cord tissue of LPS-induced mice, exhibiting significantly higher inhibition than curcumin. Moreover, the motor coordination, and locomotive behaviors of mice were not affected by both acute and chronic administration of CUR-2GE, indicating no potential CNS side effects. Thus, CUR-2GE demonstrated enhanced therapeutic efficacy in mouse models of inflammatory pain without any possible CNS side effects, suggesting its potential to be developed as an analgesic agent against inflammatory pain.', 'Scale-up synthesis and in vivo anti-tumor activity of curcumin diethyl disuccinate, an ester prodrug of curcumin, in HepG2-xenograft mice  2019 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.Previously, we synthesized curcumin and a succinate ester prodrug of curcumin namely curcumin diethyl disuccinate (CurDD) in the lab scale, which yielded hundred milligrams to few grams of the compounds. CurDD was found to be more stable in a phosphate buffer pH 7.4 and exhibited better cytotoxicity against Caco-2 cells than curcumin. Here, the one-pot syntheses of curcumin and CurDD were scaled up to afford multigram quantities of both compounds for preclinical studies using a 10-L chemical reactor. The key steps for the synthesis of curcumin were the formation of boron-acetylacetone complex and the decomplexation of boron-curcumin complex. The synthesis of CurDD could be achieved via a one-step esterification between curcumin and succinic acid monoethyl ester chloride using 4-(N,N-dimethylamino)pyridine as a catalyst. The synthesized curcumin and CurDD were then investigated and compared for an anti-tumor activity in HepG2-xenograft mice. CurDD could reduce the tumor growth in HepG2-xenograft mice better than curcumin. CurDD also exerted the stronger inhibition on VEGF secretion, COX-2 and Bcl-2 expression and induced higher Bax expression in comparison with curcumin.

Study Design: Three human hemimandibles were scanned by using the 3D Accuitomo 170 scanner (J. Morita, Kyoto, Japan). First, 3 combinations of kilovolt (kV) and milliampere (mA) were used at a constant radiation dose. Seven observers evaluated the images; the kV of the highest-scoring scan was considered optimal. Second, the lowest acceptable mA for visualizing different anatomic structures was determined. Finally, the samples were scanned by using 3 combinations of tube current and exposure time; the observers determined the combination with the highest image quality. Results: At a constant radiation dose, the highest available voltage (i.e., 90 kV) resulted in the highest image quality in terms of general impression, sharpness, noise, and artefacts. Depending on the anatomic structure, mA reductions of 20% to 40% compared with the default setting were possible. Fast-scan protocols showed equal or slightly better image quality compared with the standard-scan mode. Conclusions: For the CBCT model used in this study, optimization implies the use of the highest kV along with the shortest exposure time and a task-specific mA.

Methods: Clinical (CL) and quantitative (QUANT) evaluations of image quality were performed using an anthropomorphic phantom. Technical (TECH) evaluation was performed with a polymethyl methacrylate phantom. Images were obtained using a PaX-i3D Green CBCT (Vatech, Hwaseong, Korea) device, with a large 21 × 19 and a medium 12 × 9 cm field of view (FOV), and high-dose (HD–ranging from 85 to 110 kV) and low-dose (LD–ranging from 75 to 95 kV) protocols, totaling four groups (21 × 19 cm HD, 21 × 19 cm LD, 12 × 9 cm HD, 12 × 9 cm LD). The radiation dose within each group was fixed by adapting the mA according to a predetermined dose-area product. For CL evaluation, three observers assessed images based on overall quality, sharpness, contrast, artefacts, and noise. For QUANT evaluation, mean gray value shift, % increase of standard deviation (SD), % of beam hardening and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) were calculated. For TECH evaluation, segmentation accuracy, CNR, metal artefact SD, metal object area, and sharpness were measured.

To eliminate HCV infection in an endemic area, an epidemiological baseline of the current HCV infection in the population is required. We therefore aimed to evaluate the HCV burden in the Thai Province of Phetchabun, which has the highest HCV infection rate in the country. Toward this, a province-wide district-based representative sampling of 4,769 individuals ages 35–64 years previously shown to represent high-risk age-groups were tested for anti-HCV antibodies using the automated chemiluminescent microparticle assays. Active HCV infection and subsequent genotyping were determined from serologically reactive samples by amplification of the HCV core gene. We found that 6.9% (327/4,769) were anti-HCV positive, of which 75.8% (248/327) had detectable HCV RNA and 5.8% (19/327) were in the presence of hepatitis B virus coinfection. Nucleotide sequencing and phylogenetic analysis revealed that HCV genotype 6 was the most prevalent (41%, 101/248), followed by genotype 3 (31%, 78/248), and genotype 1 (28%, 69/248). Socioeconomic and demographic factors including male gender, education, and agricultural work were associated with HCV seropositivity. From these results, we defined the regional HCV genotypes and estimated the HCV burden necessary toward the implementation of pan-genotypic direct-acting antivirals, which may be appropriate and effective toward the diversity of genotypes identified in this study.

Efforts to micro-eliminate hepatitis in Phetchabun province in Thailand, a region where the prevalence of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection and liver cancer is higher than elsewhere in the country, began with evaluating the province-wide burden of HCV. Here, we describe a feasibility study to assess active HCV infection by screening Phetchabun residents ages 35 to 69 years for anti-HCV antibodies by using a rapid diagnostic test (RDT) at the point of care. Positive anti-HCV results were further evaluated for active infection using qualitative HCV RNA assay, followed by quantitative HCV viral load determination in a subset of samples. Currently, we have identified 6.2% (10,621/170,163) anti-HCV positive individuals, of whom 74.9% (3,930/5,246) demonstrated detectable viral RNA. Quantitative test found that 97.5% (1,001/1,027) had HCV viral load ≥5,000 IU/mL. Thus, primary screening with anti-HCV RDT followed by qualitative HCV RNA evaluation could identify active and chronic HCV infection in almost all individuals with a viral load ≥5,000 IU/mL, which is the current threshold for treatment dictated by Thailand’s National Health Security Office.

All rights reserved.Background Chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection contributes to substantial morbidity and mortality among adults living with HIV. Cascades of HCV care support monitoring of program performance, but data from Asia are limited. We assessed regional HCV coinfection and cascade outcomes among adults living with HIV in care from 2010-2020. Methods Patients ≥18 years old with confirmed HIV infection on antiretroviral therapy (ART) at 11 clinical sites in Cambodia, China, India, Indonesia, South Korea, Thailand and Vietnam were included. HCV- and HIV-related treatment and laboratory data were collected from those with a positive HCV antibody (anti-HCV) test after January 2010. An HCV cascade was evaluated, including proportions positive for anti-HCV, tested for HCV RNA or HCV core antigen (HCVcAg), initiated on HCV treatment, and achieved sustained virologic response (SVR). Factors associated with screening uptake, treatment initiation, and treatment response were analyzed using Fine and Gray's competing risk regression model. Results Of 24,421 patients, 9169 (38%) had an anti-HCV test, and 971 (11%) had a positive result. The proportion with positive anti-HCV was 12.1% in 2010-2014, 3.9% in 2015-2017, and 3.8% in 2018-2020. From 2010 to 2014, 34% with positive anti-HCV had subsequent HCV RNA or HCVcAg testing, 66% initiated HCV treatment, and 83% achieved SVR. From 2015 to 2017, 69% with positive anti-HCV had subsequent HCV RNA or HCVcAg testing, 59% initiated HCV treatment, and 88% achieved SVR. From 2018 to 2020, 80% had subsequent HCV RNA or HCVcAg testing, 61% initiated HCV treatment, and 96% achieved SVR. Having chronic HCV in later calendar years and in high-income countries were associated with increased screening, treatment initiation or achieving SVR. Older age, injecting drug use HIV exposure, lower CD4 and higher HIV RNA were associated with reduced HCV screening or treatment initiation. Conclusions Our analysis identified persistent gaps in the HCV cascade of care, highlighting the need for focused efforts to strengthen chronic HCV screening, treatment initiation, and monitoring among adult PLHIV in the Asia region.""]"

Aspen Plus was used to carry out a thermodynamic investigation into the influence of various operating conditions on hydrogen production and process thermal efficiency. The steam to carbon molar ratio (S/C), the CaO to carbon molar ratio (CaO/C), the metal oxide to carbon molar ratio (MeO/C), the metal oxide composition (NiO:CuO), and the oxidising agent species were all shown to influence the process performance. The main findings were that; (1) the introduction of CaO reduces the potential for coke formation with predicted zero coke formation for CaO/C ratios > 0.4; (2) increasing amounts of metal oxide (MeO/C) and steam (S/C) enhance the hydrogen production yield and purity; (3) due to its involvement in an exothermic reaction, the presence of CuO allows for the reforming reactor to operate as an adiabatic reactor with an operating temperature within the range of 600 °C–700 °C; (4) an increase in the NiO:CuO ratio leads to an increase in methane conversion. With the operating conditions of S/C = 3, CaO/C = 1, MeO/C = 1, NiO:CuO = 0.9 and air as the oxidising agent, a hydrogen purity as high as 98% was predicted for the SE-CL-SMR process, along with the lowest observed CO2 production rate. Under the same conditions and using pinch analysis, the thermodynamic model prediction of the thermal process efficiency is reported as ca. 86%.

As a consequence, improvement of energy production process in terms of increasing high efficiency and reducing CO2 emission are required [1]. This research verified the combined systems: biochar gasification and sorption-enhanced water gas shift reaction for the production of synthesis gas. The effect of calcium precursor on CaO-based sorbents, type of metal on multifunctional materials, and amount of co-feed CO2 as gasifying agent on process performances were focused on this work. Fixed-bed reactors were used for both gasification and sorption-enhanced water-gas shift experiments. Performances of the system were analyzed in terms of %biochar conversion, H2/CO ratio, and CO2 emission. The temperature used in the gasification process was fixed at 900°C and sorption-enhanced water-gas shift was 600°C at 1 atm. The results showed the sorbent CaO/Caj2Alj4O33 derived from calcium nitrate displayed the best performance for CO2 capture, whose CO2 capture capacity is 0.34 gCO2/g sorbent at 30%CO2v/v at 600°C.

Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.Phlebotomine sand flies are tiny, hairy, blood-sucking nematoceran insects that feed on a wide range of hosts. They are known as a principal vector of parasites, responsible for human and animal leishmaniasis worldwide. In Thailand, human autochthonous leishmaniasis and trypanosomiasis have been reported. However, information on the vectors for Leishmania and Trypanosoma in the country is still limited. Therefore, this study aims to detect Leishmania and Trypanosoma DNA in field-caught sand flies from endemic areas (Songkhla and Phatthalung Provinces) and non-endemic area (Chumphon Province) of leishmaniasis. A total of 439 sand flies (220 females and 219 males) were collected. Head and genitalia dissection of female sandflies were done for morphology identification, and the remaining parts of those sand flies were then used for the detection of Leishmania and Trypanosoma parasites. The DNA was extracted from individual female sand flies. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) anneal, specific to the ITS1 and SSU rRNA gene regions, was used to detect Leishmania and Trypanosoma DNA, respectively. The positive PCR products were cloned and sequenced. The results showed that the female sand fly species in this study consisted of Sergentomyia khawi (35.9%); Se. anodontis (23.6%); Phlebotomus betisi (18.6%); Ph. kiangsuensis (9.5%); Ph. asperulus (6.4%); Se. barraudi (2.3%); 0.9% of each Se. indica, Ph. stantoni, and Ph. major major; and 0.5% of each Se. sylvatica and Ph. mascomai. The PCR and sequence analysis were able to detect Leishmania and Trypanosoma DNA in sand fly samples, which were identified as L. martiniquensis, 1/220 (0.45%) in Se. khawi, 3/220 (1.36%) of T. noyesi in Se. anodontis, and Ph. asperulus. Fourteen (6.36%) of the unidentified trypanosome species in Se. khawi, Se. indica, Se. anodontis, Ph. asperulus, and Ph. betisi were found in all of the areas of this study. Interestingly, we found a 1/220 (0.45%) co-infection sample of L. martiniquensis and Trypanosoma in Se. khawi from Songkhla Province. These data indicate that several species of sand flies might be potential vectors of Leishmania and Trypanosoma parasites in southern Thailand. However, more extensive study for potential vectors using a larger number of sand flies should be conducted to prove whether these sand flies can be natural vectors of leishmaniasis and trypanosomiasis in both humans and animals. In addition, our study could be useful for the future study of infection prevention, including effective vector control for leishmaniasis and trypanosomiasis in Thailand.', 'Experimental transmission of Leishmania (Mundinia) parasites by biting midges (Diptera: Ceratopogonidae) Copyright:  2021 Becvar et al. This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.Leishmania parasites, causative agents of leishmaniasis, are currently divided into four subgenera: Leishmania, Viannia, Sauroleishmania and Mundinia. The recently established subgenus Mundinia has a wide geographical distribution and contains five species, three of which have the potential to infect and cause disease in humans. While the other Leishmania subgenera are transmitted exclusively by phlebotomine sand flies (Diptera: Psychodidae), natural vectors of Mundinia remain uncertain. This study investigates the potential of sand flies and biting midges of the genus Culicoides (Diptera: Ceratopogonidae) to transmit Leishmania parasites of the subgenus Mundinia. Sand flies (Phlebotomus argentipes, P. duboscqi and Lutzomyia migonei) and Culicoides biting midges (Culicoides sonorensis) were exposed to five Mundinia species through a chicken skin membrane and dissected at specific time intervals, post bloodmeal. Potentially infected insects were also allowed to feed on ear pinnae of anaesthetized BALB/c mice and the presence of Leishmania DNA was subsequently confirmed in the mice using polymerase chain reaction analyses. In C. sonorensis, all Mundinia species tested were able to establish infection at a high rate, successfully colonize the stomodeal valve and produce a higher proportion of metacyclic forms than in sand flies. Subsequently, three parasite species, L. martiniquensis, L. orientalis and L. sp. from Ghana, were transmitted to the host mouse ear by C. sonorensis bite. In contrast, transmission experiments entirely failed with P. argentipes, although colonisation of the stomodeal valve was observed for L. orientalis and L. martiniquensis and metacyclic forms of L. orientalis were recorded. This laboratory-based transmission of Mundinia species highlights that Culicoides are potential vectors of members of this ancestral subgenus of Leishmania and we suggest further studies in endemic areas to confirm their role in the lifecycles of neglected pathogens.', ""Species diversity of phlebotomine sand flies and sympatric occurrence of Leishmania (Mundinia) martiniquensis, Leishmania (Leishmania) donovani complex, and Trypanosoma spp. in the visceral leishmaniasis focus of southern Thailand  2023 Elsevier B.V.Autochthonous leishmaniasis in Thailand has recently been a public health concern due to an increasing number of new clinical cases. Most indigenous cases were diagnosed with Leishmania (Mundinia) martiniquensis, and Leishmania (Mundinia) orientalis. However, some doubts regarding vector misidentification have arisen and need to be elucidated. Accordingly, we aimed to assess the species composition of sand flies and determine the molecular prevalence of trypanosomatids in the transmission area of leishmaniasis in southern Thailand. In the present study, a total of 569 sand flies were caught from the vicinity of a visceral leishmaniasis patient's house in Na Thawi District, Songkhla Province. Of these, 229 parous and gravid females consisted of Sergentomyia khawi, Se. barraudi, Phlebotomus stantoni, Grassomyia indica, and Se. hivernus, accounting for 31.4%, 30.6%, 29.7%, 7.9%, and 0.4%, respectively. However, Se. gemmea, which has previously been proposed as the most abundant species and putative vector of visceral leishmaniasis, was not found in the present study. Based on ITS1-PCR and sequence analysis, two specimens of Gr. indica and Ph. stantoni showed positive amplification of L. martiniquensis and L. donovani complex, respectively, the first one being presumed indigenous and the second one being not. Anuran Trypanosoma was also molecularly detected using SSU rRNA-PCR and ubiquitously found in 16 specimens of four dominant sand fly species except for Se. hivernus. The obtained sequences could be phylogenetically categorized into the two major amphibian clades (An04/Frog1 and An01+An02/Frog2). The existence of the monophyletic subgroup and distinct lineage suggests them as novel Trypanosoma species. The TCS network analysis of these anuran Trypanosoma sequences also revealed high haplotype diversity (Hd = 0.925 ± 0.050), but low nucleotide diversity (π = 0.019 ± 0.009). Furthermore, the living anuran trypanosomes were microscopically demonstrated in a single specimen of Gr. indica, supporting the vectorial capacity. Importantly, our data confirmed the scarcity of Se. gemmea and also uncovered, for the first time, the co-circulation of L. martiniquensis, L. donovani complex, and suspected novel anuran Trypanosoma spp. in phlebotomine sand files, implicating their potential role as vectors of trypanosomatid parasites. Therefore, the novel data from this study would greatly facilitate the comprehension of the complexity of trypanosomatid transmission and the establishment of prevention and control measures for this neglected disease more effectively.""]"

Essential hypertension is one of the most common NCDs. Alu hypomethylation is an epigenetic event that is commonly found in elderly individuals. Epigenomic alterations are also found in age-associated NCDs such as osteoporosis and diabetes mellitus. Alu methylation prevents DNA from being damaged. Therefore, Alu hypomethylated DNA accumulates DNA damage and, as a result, causes organ function deterioration. Here, we report that Alu hypomethylation is a biomarker for essential hypertension. Results We investigated Alu methylation levels in white blood cells from normal controls, patients with prehypertension, and patients with hypertension. The hypertension group possessed the lowest Alu methylation level when classified by systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure (P = 0.0002 and P = 0.0088, respectively). In the hypertension group, a higher diastolic blood pressure and a lower Alu methylation level were observed (r = -0.6278). Moreover, we found that changes in Alu hypomethylation in the four years of follow-up in the same person were directly correlated with increased diastolic blood pressure. Conclusions Similar to other age-associated NCDs, Alu hypomethylation is found in essential hypertension and is directly correlated with severity, particularly with diastolic blood pressure. Therefore, Alu hypomethylation may be linked with the molecular pathogenesis of high blood pressure and can be used for monitoring the clinical outcome of this disease.', 'DNA damage, epigenetics, and aging  2022 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.Two types of epigenetic marks, genome-wide methylation and youth-associated genome-stabilizing DNA gaps (youth-DNA-GAPs), protect DNA from damage and may prevent the aging process. A reduction in the number of these marks is found in aging cells and promotes DNA damage. A persistentDNA damage response drives cellular senescence. The genome-wide DNA methylation marks are found within interspersed repetitive sequences (IRSs), such as the Alu element. In addition to the genome of elderly individuals, individuals with age-associated noncommunicable diseases exhibit Alu hypomethylation. The Alu methylation level is inversely associated with DNA damage. Experiments have shown that increased Alu methylation improved the stability of the genome. In yeast, youth-DNA-GAP reduction is evident during chronological aging. This reduction causes spontaneous DNA shearing. In humans, youth-DNA-GAPs are commonly found within methylated DNA. Youth-DNA-GAPs protect DNA by relieving torsional forces created by DNA activity, similar to the way small gaps between railway tracks relieve torsional forces produced by trains. In conclusion, the global hypomethylated genome of the elderly may be unstable due to the youth-DNA-GAP reduction.', 'Alu siRNA to increase Alu element methylation and prevent DNA damage  2018 Apiwat Mutirangura.Global DNA hypomethylation promoting genomic instability leads to cancer and deterioration of human health with age. Aim: To invent a biotechnology that can reprogram this process. Methods: We used Alu siRNA to direct Alu interspersed repetitive sequences methylation in human cells. We evaluated the correlation between DNA damage and Alu methylation levels. Results: We observed an inverse correlation between Alu element methylation and endogenous DNA damage in white blood cells. Cells transfected with Alu siRNA exhibited high Alu methylation levels, increased proliferation, reduced endogenous DNA damage and improved resistance to DNA damaging agents. Conclusion: Alu methylation stabilizes the genome by preventing accumulation of DNA damage. Alu siRNA could be useful for evaluating reprograming of the global hypomethylation phenotype in cancer and aging cells.']"

Water flooding has become the most widely used process by injecting water into the reservoir to displace oil. The chemical EOR is a chemical injection into the reservoir. When water flooding becomes uneconomical, the chemical especially surfactant, has been applied in the flooding process like sodium 4-vinylbenzene sulfonate (SVBS). This study aims to simulate and evaluate the surfactant flooding by using SVBS with various conditions such as surfactant concentration, injection rate, and injection period in Northern oilfield of Thailand. The concentration of SVBS varies from 0 to 4,000 ppm and the injection rate is from 7.95 to 47.7 m3/d. The period of chemical injection is from 0 to 12 y. This technique will be compared with conventional water flooding. From the results, the surfactant EOR can obtain higher recovery factor compared to water flooding. The suitable concentration is 2,000 ppm. For the injection rate, the recovery factor (RF) is higher at higher injection rate, The highest RF is up to 56.92 % from all cases of a parameter change. The period of surfactant injection to enhance oil production is 12 y. RF can be improved up to 4.2 % compared with applying water flooding for the same period. The results from this study can contribute to further EOR application in the actual field at the Northern oilfield in Thailand as a reference in the future.', 'Enhanced oil recovery: Potential for oil production development in Fang oilfield, Thailand  2020 Institute of Physics Publishing. All rights reserved.Fang oilfield is a small onshore reservoir in Thailand containing oil with gravity ranging from 20-40 °API and viscosity of approximately 10-120 cp. The depth of this field is from 300-1,200 meters and the sand thickness is varied from of 1 to 7 meters. For over 60 years of natural production, the field has low oil recovery. The difficulty has been attributed to the unfavorable production. Waterflooding, a secondary recovery, has been studied and the results show that the recovery can increase 4-6%. However, the production can be enhanced more with the tertiary recovery methods or enhanced oil recovery (EOR) which are recommended to increase oil production in this challenging field. However, the proper technologies have not been studied for commercial production yet. These technologies can be thermal recovery, gas injection, microbial enhanced oil recovery and chemical methods. Therefore, it will be the objective of this work to review and screen the EOR method to fit well with oil production in Fang oilfield in order to increase oil production. From this EOR screening, the main results from this study reveal that chemical injection is more appropriate for this field than other techniques because of reservoir characteristics and reservoir fluids. Based on the types of oil and composition in the oil, adding alkaline solution and surfactant can improve oil recovery because they can reduce interfacial tension of oil and to make the mobility higher. On the other hand, for other techniques, thermal recovery can increase mobility because of wax formation but it has higher cost. CO2 injection can increase more oil production. Nevertheless, the sources of CO2 has less supply and is expensive. Now, microbial enhanced oil recovery is on the beginning state and can provide the good potential. Consequently, based on the revision and screening method, the chemical method provide the higher commercial potential and feasibility to enhance oil production in Fang oilfield and the result of this study can be applied to design the plan of oil production operation in the oilfield in the future.', 'Simulation Study of Sodium Dodecyl Benzene Sulfonate as a Surfactant for Enhanced Oil Recovery of Fang Oilfield  2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.Sansai area in Fang oilfield is an onshore reservoir in Thailand which has oil production for over 60 years. Water flooding is applied as the method to increase more oil as well as the surfactant injection, one of the enhanced oil recovery (EOR) technology. To increase the production rate, the water flooding and surfactant injection with sodium dodecyl benzene sulfonate (SDBS) have been studied and compared the results for oil production by using the simulation with ECLIPSE. Therefore, the aim of this work is to simulate the surfactant flooding by using SDBS with various conditions such as the injection rate and the period of injection for Sansai area in Fang oilfield and to compare this technique of oil recovery with the conventional water flooding and natural flow. From the results, it shows that the surfactant method with SDBS provides the highest recovery factor at 26.7%. Also, the parameters such as injection rate are studied that the oil recovery can increase with an increase in injection rate. For the injection period of 1, 2 and 3 years of SDBS injection, the results present that 3-year injection can provide the highest oil recovery at 33.1%. However, the maximum difference of oil recovery factor is less than 5%. Therefore, in term of economic consideration, 1-year injection period might be better. This work can be used for the further study in applying this technology in this field in future.']"

Modern onshore and offshore sediment samples were compared with the 2004 Indian Ocean Tsunami, three palaeotsunami and a 2007 storm deposit from Phra Thong Island, Thailand, to determine provenance relationships between these coastal overwash deposits. Sedimentological and stratigraphic characteristics are generally inadequate to discriminate tsunami and storm deposits so a statistical approach (including cluster analysis, principal component analysis and discriminant function analysis) was used based on grain size, mineralogy and trace element geochemistry. The mineral content and trace element geochemistry are statistically inadequate to distinguish the provenance of the modern storm and tsunami deposits at this site, but the mean grain size can potentially discriminate these overwash deposits. The 2007 storm surge deposits were most likely sourced from the onshore sediment environment whereas all four tsunami units statistically differ from each other indicating diverse sediment sources. Our statistical analyses suggest that the 2004 tsunami deposit was mainly derived from nearshore marine sediments. The uppermost palaeotsunami deposit was possibly derived from both onshore and nearshore materials while the lower palaeotsunami deposits showed no clear evidence of their sediment sources. Such complexity raises questions about the origin of the sediments in the tsunami and storm deposits and strongly suggests that local context and palaeogeography are important aspects that cannot be ignored in tsunami provenance studies.', 'Distinguishing Late Holocene Storm Deposit From Shore-normal Beach Sediments From the Gulf of Thailand  Copyright  2021 Kongsen, Phantuwongraj and Choowong.Grain size, as one of sedimentological proxies, coupled with a detailed description of the sedimentary structures and luminescence dating were used to unveil the sediment sources and transport process of the Holocene ancient coastal storm events recorded in the beach ridge plain, wet swale and muddy environments at Prachuap Khiri Khan, in the Southern Peninsula of Thailand. In this study, a total of 141 sand samples were collected from the shore-normal ridge-swale topography and analyzed for layers of candidate storm deposits, revealing at least 21 candidate coastal storm events. The grain size distribution of beach sediments was, in general, unimodal, while the candidate storm sediments revealed a mixed combination of multimodal, bimodal and unimodal distributions. Plots of mean grain size against skewness and kurtosis and of skewness against kurtosis could differentiate storm deposits from shore-normal beach sediments. Sedimentary structures preserved in the ancient coastal storm deposits included parallel and inclined landward laminations, mud rip-up clasts, layers of shell fragments, a pebble grain, normal and reverse grading and sharp lower and upper contacts. Candidate storm layers overlain on a dry beach ridge intervened with mud in a swale showed a finer and thinner landward deposit. Marine shell fragments, smaller foraminifers, ostracod and scaphopod (tusk shell), were well preserved. Based on optically stimulated luminescence dating and a correlated accelerator mass spectrometry age, multiple layers of sand derived from different frequencies of coastal storms were deposited over the middle to late Holocene.', 'Multi-proxy approach to identify the origin of high energy coastal deposits from Laem Son National Park, Andaman Sea of Thailand  2022 Elsevier Ltd and INQUAUnderstanding the frequency of high energy storm and tsunami events is crucial for apprehending the vulnerability of coastal communities. Identifying and dating sedimentary evidence deposited by such high energy events can assist in the planning and installation of suitable protection measurements. The Andaman Sea coast of Thailand is particularly vulnerable to such events as illustrated by the 2004 Indian Ocean Tsunami. Here, three shore-perpendicular transects and ten sediment cores along a beach ridge in the northern part of Lam Son National Park, Ranong Province, Andaman Sea coast are investigated with respect to high energy deposits. A multi-proxy analysis was conducted including stratigraphical correlations between cores, detailed description of physical characteristics, sedimentary structure, grain size, organic matter and carbonate content as well as identification of the remains of marine organisms. Optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) dating was applied for determining the age of the sediments on this beach ridge plain. The stratigraphy and sediment characteristics, in particular composition, of the sands in the study area clearly allow us to distinguish between high energy deposits and normal beach sediments. Two high energy deposits were identified and attributed to result from the 2004 Indian Ocean Tsunami as well as a past storm, which, based on OSL dating occurred more than 340 ± 20 years ago.']"

An array of datasets has been generated with the use of diverse emotion-eliciting stimuli and the resulting brainwave responses conventionally captured with high-end EEG devices. However, the applicability of these devices is to some extent limited by practical constraints and may prove difficult to be deployed in highly mobile context omnipresent in everyday happenings. In this study, we evaluate the potential of OpenBCI to bridge this gap by first comparing its performance to research grade EEG system, employing the same algorithms that were applied on benchmark datasets. Moreover, for the purpose of emotion classification, we propose a novel method to facilitate the selection of audio-visual stimuli of high/low valence and arousal. Our setup entailed recruiting 200 healthy volunteers of varying years of age to identify the top 60 affective video clips from a total of 120 candidates through standardized self assessment, genre tags, and unsupervised machine learning. In addition, 43 participants were enrolled to watch the pre-selected clips during which emotional EEG brainwaves and peripheral physiological signals were collected. These recordings were analyzed and extracted features fed into a classification model to predict whether the elicited signals were associated with a high or low level of valence and arousal.

The scheme involves two main steps: model estimation and model inference to estimate brain connectivity. The model estimation performs a subspace identification and active source selection based on group-norm regularized least-squares. The model inference relies on the concept of state-space GC that requires solving a Riccati equation for the covariance of estimation error. We verify the performance on simulated datasets that represent realistic human brain activities under several conditions, including percentages and location of active sources, and the number of EEG electrodes. Our model's accuracy in estimating connectivity is compared with a two-stage approach using source reconstructions and a VAR-based Granger analysis. Our method achieved better performances than the two-stage approach under the assumptions that the true source dynamics are sparse and generated from state-space models.

In this paper, the objective is to create an emotion recognition model that can be applied to multiple subjects. By adopting convolutional neural networks (CNNs), advantage could be gained from utilizing information from electrodes and time steps. Using CNNs also does not need feature extraction which might leave out other related but unobserved features. CNNs with three to seven convolutional layers were deployed in this research. We measured their performance with a binary classification task for compositions of emotions including arousal and valence. The results showed that our method captured EEG signal patterns from numerous subjects by 10-fold cross validation with 81.54% and 86.87% accuracy from arousal and valence respectively.

Cyclodextrin (CD) inclusion complexation is a method of choice for reducing side effects and improving bioavailability of drugs. Here, we investigate in-depth the β-CD encapsulation of sertraline (STL) HCl (1) and fluoxetine (FXT) HCl (2) by single-crystal X-ray diffraction and DFT complete-geometry optimization, in comparison to the reported complex of paroxetine (PXT) base. X-ray analysis unveiled the 2:2 β-CD–STL/FXT complexes with two drug molecules inserting their halogen-containing aromatic ring in the β-CD dimeric cavity, which are stabilized by the interplay of intermolecular O2–H⋯N1–H⋯O3 H-bonds, C3/C5–H⋯π and halogen⋯halogen interactions. Similarly, the 1:1 β-CD–tricyclic-antidepressant (TCA) complexes have an exclusive inclusion mode of the aromatic ring, which is maintained by C3/C5–H⋯π interactions. By contrast, the 2:1 β-CD–PXT complex has a total inclusion that is stabilized by host–guest O6–H⋯N1–H⋯O5 H-bonds and C3–H⋯π interactions. The inherent stabilization energies of 1 and 2 evaluated using DFT calculation suggested that the improved thermodynamic stabilities via CD encapsulation facilitates the reduction of drug side effects.

X-ray analysis discloses that the A–C-rings are buried in the β-CD cavity and the side chain is mostly outside the cavity, nearby the O2–H/O3–H side. Hence, the inclusion structures of both complexes are stabilized by host–guest C5–H∙∙∙π interaction and N5′–H∙∙∙O5/O6 H-bonds of twofold-screw-symmetry-related molecules, which are similar to those of the reported complexes of nortriptyline and amitriptyline. The DFT full-geometry optimization in the gas phase reveals an alternative inclusion scenario with the TCA side chain that is embedded in the β-CD cavity and stabilized by intermolecular O6–H∙∙∙N5’ H-bond and O2–H/O3–H∙∙∙π interactions. The β-CD encapsulation of the TCA side chain is more energetically stable by 10.76 and 4.70 kcal mol−1 than that of the aromatic moiety for the respective complexes of DPM and IPM, based on the relative stabilization energies (ΔΔEstb). This suggests the existence of the bimodal β-CD–TCA inclusion complexes as spectroscopically observed in solution, thus explaining the controversy in the inclusion mode and the improvement of TCA therapeutic effect by CD encapsulation.']"

The purpose of this study was to provide anatomical information on the infraorbital artery distribution and its relationship with the facial artery for use in clinical procedures involving filler injection during nasolabial fold augmentation. Methods: The infraorbital artery was investigated in the nasolabial fold region divided into zones I to XII based on clock-hour meridians centered on the infraorbital foramen. The running layers of the infraorbital artery and infraorbital nerve were also compared in the infraorbital foramen. Changes in the infraorbital artery were observed according to vascular dominance of the facial artery.

The tacrolimus concentration within peripheral blood mononuclear cells ([Tac]cells) might correlate better with clinical outcomes. The aim of this study was to investigate the correlation between [Tac]blood and [Tac]cells, the evolution of [Tac]cells and the [Tac]cells/[Tac]blood ratio, and to assess the relationship between tacrolimus concentrations and the occurrence of rejection. Methods: In this prospective study, samples for the measurement of [Tac]blood and [Tac]cells were collected on days 3 and 10 after kidney transplantation, and on the morning of a for-cause kidney transplant biopsy.

Conclusion: Tacrolimus exposure and distribution appeared stable in the early phase after transplantation. [Tac]cells was not significantly associated with the occurrence of rejection.

Increased reaction temperature to 400 °C obtained the highest ethylene yield (ca. 43.7%) with this catalyst because of both acid site and Pd site.', 'Catalytic dehydration of ethanol to ethylene and diethyl ether over alumina catalysts containing different phases with boron modification  2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.The catalytic ethanol dehydration of ethanol over the solvothermal-derived alumina catalysts was investigated in this study. First, alumina catalysts were synthesized by the solvothermal methods to obtain three different phase composition of alumina catalysts including γ-phase (G–Al), χ-phase (C–Al) and equally mixed χ–γ phases (M–Al). Then, all catalysts were modified with boron (G–Al–B, C–Al–B and M–Al–B). It was found that the boron modification increased the amounts of total acid sites and the ratio of weak to strong acid sites (WSR). The catalytic activity and product selectivity of six catalysts via catalytic ethanol dehydration at 200, 300, and 400 °C were measured. For all catalysts, it revealed that ethanol conversion increased with increased temperatures from 200 to 400 °C. At 200–300 °C, the unmodified catalysts tended to exhibit the higher catalytic activity than the boron-modified catalysts. However, at high temperature (400 °C), the boron modification tended to increase the catalytic activity, especially for the M–Al–B catalyst (complete ethanol conversion at 400 °C). Considering ethylene production, the M–Al–B exhibited the highest ethylene yield among other catalysts with 92% at 400 °C. For diethyl ether, it was observed that the M–Al catalyst gave the highest diethyl ether yield of 57% at 300 °C. This is because the boron modification increased the amounts of total acid sites, which can promote the production of ethylene, while this is not preferable for diethyl ether production, which is favored by weak acid sites.', 'Dehydrogenation of ethanol to acetaldehyde over co/C catalysts  2019, Chulalongkorn University. All rights reserved.This study focuses on the production of acetaldehyde from ethanol by catalytic dehydrogenation using Co/C catalysts with different Co loading on the activated carbon derived from coffee ground residues. The simple impregnation was used to obtain the Co/C catalysts having Co loading of ca. 4 and 6 wt%. The catalysts were characterized using various techniques. The dehydrogenation of vaporized ethanol was conducted in order to measure the catalytic activity and product distribution at temperatures ranging from 250 to 400°C. Based on this study, it appeared that the Co/C catalyst having ca. 4 wt% of cobalt loading (4%Co/C) exhibited the highest ethanol conversion (54%) at 400oC with the acetaldehyde yield of 50%. In addition, all catalysts behaved similar catalytic properties, where the ethanol conversion increased with increasing the reaction temperature having acetaldehyde as a major product. The high activity obtained from 4%Co/C and C catalysts can be remarkably attributed to the high acidity to basicity (~1.50). Hence, the 4%Co/C is promising catalyst for ethanol dehydrogenation to acetaldehyde.']"

All rights reserved.The recent residue solid waste management has become a significant global concern. Due to the increase of population, the economic growth and the urban expansion, the number of solid waste has heavily risen. However, there are still lack of an appropriated solid waste management. According to Tan Deaw soild waste survey report in 2019 (Regional Environmental Office 7 Saraburi, 2018), it revealed that Tan Deaw sub-district has been facing critical solid waste management issues. This area produced 9.41 metric tons per day, while the appropriated solid waste disposal management was less than 40 percent and residue waste remains around 2,000 MTs. Therefore, the objectives of this research are to develop learning community and public awareness towards the appropriated solid waste disposal management, including 3Rs principle, to develop the systemic solid waste management strategies with the engagement from all stakeholders, and to promote and support collaborative activities among local people in the community and the concerned stakeholders in the solid waste management. A systemic approach, through participatory action research between Soft Systems Methodology (SSM) (Checkland & Scholes, 1990; Checkland & Poulter, 2006) and Critical Systems Heuristic (CSH) (Ulrich, 1983), is a significant application for structuring the process of collecting perspective from all stakeholders, exploring the key problems of solid waste management, and finding out strategies to address the key problems in Tan-Deaw solid waste management afterwards. Root definitions and models were generated by stakeholders for two activity systems identified by them for attention: Activities promoting knowledge about solid waste sorting and a community waste bank. The findings explored the seven strategies to address Tan-Deaw solid waste management problems in two aspects. This research contributes to both theoretical and practical contributions. In terms of the theoretical contribution, the application of systemic approach conducts a significant knowledge surrounding solid waste management problem solving. Regarding the practical implication, the strategies will address the solid waste problems and barriers in the area with the cooperation of all concerned stakeholders.', 'Life Cycle Assessment of Integrated Municipal Organic Waste Management Systems in Thailand  2022 by the authors.The majority of municipal solid waste in Thailand is organic waste including food and garden waste. Improper waste management has caused negative impacts on the environment. This study aimed to find a hypothetical municipal organic waste management scenario with the lowest environmental impacts using life cycle assessment (LCA). The system boundary of organic waste management includes collection and transportation; treatment, including centralized and on-site treatment technologies; and by-product utilization. The two main waste management systems considered in this study were centralized and on-site waste management systems. The first two scenarios take into account all the amount of the municipal organic waste collected and transported and then treated by centralized waste treatment technologies (composting, anaerobic digestion, and landfill). The remaining three scenarios are integrated between 10% on-site (home composting, food waste processor, and composting bin) and 90% centralized (composting, anaerobic digestion, and incineration) waste treatment technologies; the scenario combining centralized (food waste anaerobic digestion, garden waste composting, and incineration) and on-site (home composting) systems yielded the lowest environmental impacts (except short-term climate change, freshwater, and marine eutrophication). On-site systems can help reduce collection, transportation, and treatment impacts, particularly photochemical oxidant formation, which was proportional to the amount of waste or distance reduced. Benefits from the by-product utilization can offset all impacts in terms of fossil and nuclear energy use and freshwater acidification, and result in a negative impact score or impact reduction. This research can be used as guidance for developing countries with conditions and waste composition similar to Thailand for making initial decisions on environmentally sustainable municipal organic waste management.', 'Smart Waste Management Model for Effective Disposal of Waste Management Through Technology  2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.Generation of waste is an essential part of ecological cycle and is found in every element of ecosystem. With an increase in population and an expansion in urbanization, waste production has become area centric. In addition, the developments in technology and luxury appliances to meet the demands of this urban population have increased multiple types of solid waste which differ in composition and their ability to decompose. For example, recently we have seen an increase in medical waste, e-waste, and also chemical waste which had not been there before three decades. Hence waste management becomes an important responsibility of all the stakeholders producing waste and authorities handling human locale and ecosystem. Waste management refers to a waste collection system, including its transportation, disposal, or reusing, and it must be effectively handled to avoid its undesirable effect on the health and the environment. Increase in urbanization, especially in developing countries like India, accounts for most of the irregularities in governance since the infrastructure, human resources, and facilities have not been preplanned for the rapid increase. According to the Census of India report in 2011, the urban population crossed 377 million accounting for 31% of the total population. According to Kumar and Gaikwad (2004), the rate of urbanization increases if the urban population exceeds 25% of total population. This in turn can produce a sharp rise in waste generation also, which in fact is corroborated by the data collected on the municipal solid waste (MSW). With generation of 133,760 tons of municipal solid waste per day, it is very much essential for us to go smart for both collection and treatment since the former is only 68.14% and the latter is a mere 19.35% of generation. Cities top the list in generation per capita in India with 0.17 kg in small towns compared to 0.62 kg in cities. With the prediction toward more increase in population, this is expected only to increase and not decrease in any way. With India’s MSW management still in landfill methods, it is going to be difficult to be efficient in waste management even in the near future. It is essential for us to turn to technology for waste management immediately. For example, the wastes we are creating every day can be converted into something good, such as electricity, heat, or fuel. In addition, the administration of the waste in different environments like rural and urban can be effectively planned with the help of technology. Internet of Things has been used in governance of waste management systems in advanced countries, right from the waste collection and classification to waste transformation, thus creating an effective recycling and connected systems across utilities. This chapter discusses the types of waste, waste generation, and waste management with a difference in rural and urban environment and the various considerations connected with both. In addition, the various technologies used for the different steps in waste management of the different types of waste have been elaborately discussed. Objectives 1.To identify the differences in technology and the standards used in waste collection and waste management methods based on environment2.To propose an effective and connected IoT-based waste management model to be implemented across the community utility systems covering the various kinds of waste generated']"

M. speciosa, or “Kratom” in Thai, is the only narcotic species that has been prohibited by law in Thailand. It causes addiction and sometimes fatalities when overdosed. The accurate detection of this species is needed in forensic justice for legal proceedings. In this study, we aim to develop an assay based on DNA barcoding for the detection of M. speciosa in forensic specimens. DNA barcodes of the matK, rbcL, psbA-trnH and ITS2 regions of the four Mitragyna species were established. The matK nucleotide signature site was selected as a target for the discrimination of M. speciosa, a narcotic species, from non-narcotics by using PCR-reverse dot blot (RDB) hybridization assay. This RDB assay is highly specific and selective for M. speciosa, costs little and is easily performed without advanced analytical equipment. This method is an alternative to DNA sequencing for the detection of M. speciosa in suspected samples. Using PCR-RDB to detect the polymorphisms of matK holds promise as a routine method to test for the presence of M. speciosa in forensic specimens.', 'DNA barcoding of Aristolochia plants and development of species-specific multiplex PCR to aid HPTLC in ascertainment of Aristolochia herbal materials  2018 Dechbumroong et al.

However, herbal materials derived from Aristolochia species have been identified as potent human carcinogens since the first case of severe renal disease after ingesting these herbal preparations. Any products containing Aristolochia species have thus been banned on many continents, including Europe, America and Asia. Therefore, the development of a method to identify these herbs is critically needed for customer safety. The present study evaluated DNA barcoding of the rbcL, matK, ITS2 and trnH-psbA regions among eleven Aristolochia species collected in Thailand. Polymorphic sites were observed in all four DNA loci. Among those eleven Aristolochia species, three species (A. pierrei, A. tagala and A. pothieri) are used as herbal materials in Thai folk medicine, namely, in Thai “Krai-Krue”. “Krai-Krue” herbs are interchangeably used as an admixture in Thai traditional remedies without specific knowledge of their identities. A species-specific multiplex PCR based on nucleotide polymorphisms in the ITS2 region was developed as an identification tool to differentiate these three Aristolochia species and to supplement the HPTLC pattern in clarifying the origins of herbal materials. The combination of multiplex PCR and HPTLC profiling achieves accurate herbal identification with the goal of protecting consumers from the health risks associated with product substitution and contamination.', 'Differentiation of Mitragyna speciosa, a narcotic plant, from allied Mitragyna species using DNA barcoding-high-resolution melting (Bar-HRM) analysis  2021, The Author(s).Mitragyna speciosa (Korth.)

However, it has been extensively covered in national and international news, as its abuse has become more popular. M. speciosa is a narcotic plant and has been used as an opium substitute and traditionally used for the treatment of chronic pain and various illnesses. Due to morphological disparities in the genus, the identification of plants in various forms, including fresh leaves, dried leaf powder, and finished products, is difficult. In this study, DNA barcoding combined with high-resolution melting (Bar-HRM) analysis was performed to differentiate M. speciosa from allied Mitragyna and to assess the capability of Bar-HRM assays to identify M. speciosa in suspected kratom or M. speciosa-containing samples. Bar-HRM analysis of PCR amplicons was based on the ITS2, rbcL, trnH-psbA, and matK DNA barcode regions. The melting profiles of ITS2 amplicons were clearly distinct, which enabled the authentication and differentiation of Mitragyna species from allied species. This study reveals that DNA barcoding coupled with HRM is an efficient tool with which to identify M. speciosa and M. speciosa-containing samples and ensure the safety and quality of traditional Thai herbal medicines.']"

The objective of this study was to determine the effects of salicylic acid (SA), chitosan (CHI) and methyl jasmonate (MeJA) elicitation applied at different concentrations to suspension cells of Pueraria candollei var. mirifica (PM) on the contents of isoflavonoid, antioxidant, and antiaging activities. Six standards of isoflavonoids, namely, daidzein, genistein, daidzin, genistin, khwakhurin and puerarin, were determined by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). To our knowledge, SA elicitation was first reported in this study and showed the highest accumulation of daidzein (2.37 mg/g DW), khwakhurin (1.05 mg/g DW), genistin (0.14 mg/g DW) and puerarin (5.13 mg/g DW). CHI elicitation gave favorable results, and the amounts of daidzein, genistein, khwakhurin and puerarin quantified were 2.24, 0.29, 1.04, and 1.80 mg/g DW, respectively. MeJA elicitation was the least effective method of all three elicitors. The results from DPPH-based assays suggested that extract from SA elicitation had the greatest antioxidant activity, followed by nonelicited cells (control), CHI, and MeJA elicitation. We also further evaluated the biological activities of PM extracts with elicitors on human dermal fibroblasts. We found that salicylic acid is the most promising elicitor to enhance the biological activities of PM extracts. The PM extract from SA-elicited cells promoted the proliferation of fibroblasts by approximately 20%. Furthermore, pretreatment with SA-elicited extract can prevent fibroblasts from experiencing oxidative insults, such as H2O2. The pharmacological data on fibroblasts support the antioxidant activities, implying the antiaging activities of PM extract. Taken together, our study clearly supports the potential utility of cell suspension culture of PM in the pharmaceutical and cosmeceutical industries to enhance the production of isoflavonoids and other active components.', 'Transcriptome analysis of Pueraria candollei var. mirifica for gene discovery in the biosyntheses of isoflavones and miroestrol  2019 The Author(s).Background: Pueraria candollei var. mirifica, a Thai medicinal plant used traditionally as a rejuvenating herb, is known as a rich source of phytoestrogens, including isoflavonoids and the highly estrogenic miroestrol and deoxymiroestrol. Although these active constituents in P. candollei var. mirifica have been known for some time, actual knowledge regarding their biosynthetic genes remains unknown. Results: Miroestrol biosynthesis was reconsidered and the most plausible mechanism starting from the isoflavonoid daidzein was proposed. A de novo transcriptome analysis was conducted using combined P. candollei var. mirifica tissues of young leaves, mature leaves, tuberous cortices, and cortex-excised tubers. A total of 166,923 contigs was assembled for functional annotation using protein databases and as a library for identification of genes that are potentially involved in the biosynthesis of isoflavonoids and miroestrol. Twenty-one differentially expressed genes from four separate libraries were identified as candidates involved in these biosynthetic pathways, and their respective expressions were validated by quantitative real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Notably, isoflavonoid and miroestrol profiling generated by LC-MS/MS was positively correlated with expression levels of isoflavonoid biosynthetic genes across the four types of tissues. Moreover, we identified R2R3 MYB transcription factors that may be involved in the regulation of isoflavonoid biosynthesis in P. candollei var. mirifica. To confirm the function of a key-isoflavone biosynthetic gene, P. candollei var. mirifica isoflavone synthase identified in our library was transiently co-expressed with an Arabidopsis MYB12 transcription factor (AtMYB12) in Nicotiana benthamiana leaves. Remarkably, the combined expression of these proteins led to the production of the isoflavone genistein. Conclusions: Our results provide compelling evidence regarding the integration of transcriptome and metabolome as a powerful tool for identifying biosynthetic genes and transcription factors possibly involved in the isoflavonoid and miroestrol biosyntheses in P. candollei var. mirifica.', 'Optimizing Pueraria candollei var. mirifica cell suspension culture for prolonged maintenance and decreased variation of isoflavonoid from single cell lines  2018, Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature.Isoflavonoids are naturally occurring polyphenolic compounds that have various biochemical and pharmacological properties. The tuberous roots of Pueraria candollei var. mirifica contain isoflavonoids and are widely used as dietary supplements and in therapeutics. The present study was aimed at producing reliable sources of isoflavonoids from single Pueraria cells and at optimizing a culture medium with increased biomass and isoflavonoid content. The medium optimized for prolonged maintenance of callus was MS medium supplemented with 200 mg/L KH2PO4, 1 mg/L thiamine HCl, 100 mg/L of myo-inositol with 0.2 mg/L 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) and subculturing for 30 days for the highest growth. The amount of isoflavonoids varied among calli obtained from different explants. The highest amounts of puerarin and daidzein were quantified as 0.63 and 1.80 mg/g of dry weight (DW) in the examined suspension cell culture of single clones, whereas daidzein (0.50 mg/g) and genistein (0.03 mg/g) were present in the suspension cell culture obtained from a mixture of cells. The suspension of cell cultures from the same origin gave comparable amounts of isoflavonoids, but cells from different sources showed varied amounts of isoflavonoids. The amount of isoflavonoid also varied depending on the cell age. The present study provided the first evidence of Pueraria cell suspension from single cells and highlighted the importance of screening the starting cells from a single cell line and the cell age prior to the scale-up process to select desired sources of isoflavonoid compounds.']"

The aim of this study was to determine urinary shedding of Leptospira in dogs in Thailand, to evaluate antibody prevalence by microscopic agglutination test (MAT) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and to assess risk factors for Leptospira infection. In Northern, Northeastern, and Central Thailand, 273 stray (n = 119) or client-owned (n = 154) dogs from rural (n = 139) or urban (n = 134) areas were randomly included. Dogs that had received antibiotics within 4 weeks prior to sampling were excluded. No dog had received vaccination against Leptospira. Urine was evaluated by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) specific for lipL32 gene of pathogenic Leptospira. Additionally, urine was cultured for 6 months in Ellinghausen-McCullough-Johnson-Harris (EMJH) medium.

In Thailand, Leptospira interrogans is a major cause of leptospirosis. Leptospirosis patients present with a wide range of clinical manifestations from asymptomatic, mild infections to severe illness involving organ failure. For better understanding the difference between Lep-tospira isolates causing mild and severe leptospirosis, illumina sequencing was used to sequence genomic DNA in both serotypes. DNA of Leptospira isolated from two patients, one with mild and another with severe symptoms, were included in this study. The paired-end reads were removed adapters and trimmed with Q30 score using Trimmomatic. Trimmed reads were constructed to contigs and scaffolds using SPAdes. Cross-contamination of scaffolds was evaluated by ContEst16s. Prokka tool for bacterial annotation was used to annotate sequences from both Leptospira isolates. Predicted amino acid sequences from Prokka were searched in EggNOG and David gene ontology database to characterize gene ontology. In addition, Leptospira from mild and severe patients, that passed the criteria e-value < 10e-5 from blastP against virulence factor database, were used to analyze with Venn diagram. From this study, we found 13 and 12 genes that were unique in the isolates from mild and severe patients, respectively. The 12 genes in the severe isolate might be virulence factor genes that affect disease severity. However, these genes should be validated in further study.', 'Update on molecular diagnosis of human leptospirosis  2019 Teerasit Techawiwattanaboon et al., published by Sciendo.Leptospirosis, caused by pathogenic Leptospira spp., is a widespread zoonotic disease worldwide.

To summarize current literature regarding commonly used and new promising molecular approaches to Leptospira detection and diagnostic tests of human leptospirosis. The relevant articles in Leptospira and leptospirosis were retrieved from MEDLINE (PubMed) and Scopus. Several molecular techniques have been developed for diagnosis of human leptospirosis. Polymerase chain reaction-based techniques targeting on either lipL32 or 16S rRNA (rrs) gene are most commonly used to detect leptospiral DNA in various clinical specimens. Whole blood and urine are recommended specimens for suspected cases in the first (acute) and the second (immune) phases, respectively. Isothermal amplification with less expensive instrument is an alternative DNA detection technique that may be suitable for resource-limited laboratories. Detection of leptospiral DNA in clinical specimens using molecular techniques enhances sensitivity for diagnosis of leptospirosis. The efficient and robust molecular detection especially in the early leptospiremic phase may prompt early and appropriate treatment leading to reduced morbidity and mortality of patients with leptospirosis.']"

METHODS Children diagnosed with EA with suspected GERD and followed up at King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital between January 2000 and December 2018 were prospectively studied. All underwent esophagogastroduodenoscopy with esophageal biopsy and Video MII-pH study on the same day. Symptoms of GERD which included both esophageal and extra-esophageal symptom were recorded from video monitoring and abnormal reflux from MII-pH study based on the statement from the European Paediatric Impedance Group. Prevalence of GERD was also reported by using histopathology as a gold standard. Endoscopic appearance was recorded using Los Angeles Classification and esophagitis severity was graded using Esohisto criteria. RESULTS Fifteen children were recruited with age of 3.1 (2.2, 9.8) years (40%, male) and the common type was C (93.3%). The symptoms recorded were cough (75.2%), vomiting (15.2%), irritability or unexplained crying (7.6%) and dysphagia (1.9%) with the symptom-reflux association of 45.7%, 89%, 71% and 0%, respectively. There were abnormal endoscopic appearance in 52.9%, esophagitis in 64.7% and high reflux score in 47.1%. Video MII-pH study has high diagnostic value with the sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of 72.7%, 100% and 82.4%, respectively. CONCLUSION Prevalence of GERD in children with EA was high. Video MII-pH study to detect GERD in children with EA had high diagnostic value with the trend of specific symptom association.', '2020 Seoul consensus on the diagnosis and management of gastroesophageal reflux disease  2021 Korean Society of Neurogastroenterology and Motility. All rights reserved.Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is a condition in which gastric contents regurgitate into the esophagus or beyond, resulting in either troublesome symptoms or complications. GERD is heterogeneous in terms of varied manifestations, test findings, and treatment responsiveness. GERD diagnosis can be established with symptomatology, pathology, or physiology. Recently the Lyon consensus defined the ""proven GERD"" with concrete evidence for reflux, including advanced grade erosive esophagitis (Los Angeles classification grades C and or D esophagitis), long-segment Barrett\'s mucosa or peptic strictures on endoscopy or distal esophageal acid exposure time > 6% on 24-hour ambulatory pH-impedance monitoring. However, some Asian researchers have different opinions on whether the same standards should be applied to the Asian population. The prevalence of GERD is increasing in Asia. The present evidence-based guidelines were developed using a systematic review and meta-analysis approach. In GERD with typical symptoms, a proton pump inhibitor test can be recommended as a sensitive, cost-effective, and practical test for GERD diagnosis. Based on a meta-analysis of 19 estimated acid-exposure time values in Asians, the reference range upper limit for esophageal acid exposure time was 3.2% (95% confidence interval, 2.7-3.9%) in the Asian countries. Esophageal manometry and novel impedance measurements, including mucosal impedance and a post-reflux swallow-induced peristaltic wave, are promising in discrimination of GERD among different reflux phenotypes, thus increasing its diagnostic yield. We also propose a long-term strategy of evidence-based GERD treatment with proton pump inhibitors and other drugs.']"

This study aimed to evaluate the impact of this guideline on achieving energy and protein delivery goals. Methods: Medical records of the patients admitted in the PICU from August 2015 to April 2017 were retrospectively reviewed. Patients who stayed in the PICU for less than 24 h or had an inborn error of metabolism were excluded. Achievement of nutritional goals was compared between the patients during the pre-implementation period (August to October 2015) and post-implementation period (November 2015 to April 2017) of the guideline. Subgroup analysis by protocol compliance was conducted in the post-implementation group. Results: A total of 215 patients were included in the study (53 pre-implementation, 162 post-implementation). There were no differences between the two groups in patient characteristics, time to start enteral nutrition, time to reach the energy delivery goal, time to reach the protein delivery goal, and proportion of the patients who reached each goal. In the post-implementation group, parenteral nutrition was delayed to three days compared with one day in pre-implementation (p = 0.027) and the proportion of patients who did not receive nutrition support was lower (3.1% vs 9.4% pre-implementation, p = 0.043). Subgroup analysis in the post-implementation group showed that 69.7% of the patients were protocol compliant, of which the time to reach the energy delivery goal (59 vs 103 h, p < 0.001) and protein delivery goal (64 vs 135 h, p = 0.02) were significantly shorter compared with the non-compliant group. Moreover, the proportion of the patients who reached the energy delivery goal (75.2% vs 24.5%, p < 0.001) and protein delivery goal (56.6% vs 12.2%, p < 0.001) were higher in the compliant group. Conclusions: Compliance with the nutrition support guideline significantly improved the achievements in delivering energy and protein to patients in PICU. Increasing compliance with the guideline may improve clinical outcomes in PICU patients.', 'Optimal Enteral Nutrition Support Preserved Muscle Mass in Critically Ill Children  2022 Kantisa Sirianansopa et al.Background. Inflammation and immobility are the most relevant mechanisms that alter protein synthesis and increase protein breakdown. Protein catabolism is associated with morbidity and mortality in critically ill children. Objective. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the routinely used enteral nutrition support guideline in preventing muscle breakdown in critically ill children. Methods. A prospective cohort study was conducted in the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) of a tertiary care hospital. Critically ill children (aged 1 month to 15 years) admitted to the PICU were enrolled. All patients were assessed for nutritional status and nutritional requirement. Enteral nutrition support following the guideline was initiated within the first 24 hours if no contraindication. The calorie target was defined either by direct measurement from indirect calorimetry or estimated from Schofield equation with protein target at least 1.5 g/kg/day. Anthropometric assessments and body composition measurements by bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) were examined at baseline and on the seventh day of the PICU admission. Results. Sixty-three patients were enrolled in the study. The most common age group was 1-5 years old (38.1%). The length of PICU stay was 9.1 (SD = 12.7) days. Respiratory problems were the major cause of PICU admission (50.8%). Mechanical ventilation was required in 55.6% of the patients with the average duration of 6.3 (SD = 12.4) days. Undernutrition was found in 36.5% of the patients. Enteral feeding was the major route of nutrition support (95.2%). After the first week of admission, muscle mass was significantly preserved (p<0.01). All patients received the nutrition support at their target energy and protein goal within the first week. The enteral feeding-related complication was reported in 1.6% of the patients. Conclusion. Protein catabolism during critically ill period can be minimized by optimal nutrition support. Nutrition practice using the enteral nutrition support guideline was effective in helping critically ill children reach their target caloric and protein intake.', 'The utilization of the surviving sepsis campaign care bundles in the treatment of pediatric patients with severe sepsis or septic shock in a resource-limited environment: A prospective multicenter trial  2018 Medknow Publications. All rights reserved.Background: Sepsis is a common condition affecting the lives of infants and children worldwide. Although implementation of the surviving sepsis campaign (SSC) care bundles was once believed to be effective in reducing sepsis mortality rates, the approach has recently been questioned. Methods: The study was a prospective, interventional, multicenter trial. Infants and children aged 1 month to 15 years in seven different large academic centers in Thailand who had been diagnosed with severe sepsis or septic shock. They were given treatment based on the SSC care bundles. Results: A total of 519 children with severe sepsis or septic shock were enrolled in the study. Among these, 188 were assigned to the intervention group and 331 were recruited to the historical case-control group. There were no significant differences in the baseline clinical characteristics. The intervention group was administered a significantly higher fluid bolus than was the control group (28.3 ± 17.2 cc/kg vs. 17.7 ± 10.6 cc/kg; P = 0.02) with early vasopressor used (1.5 ± 0.7 h) compared to control group (7.4 ± 2.4 h, P < 0.05). More importantly, our sepsis mortality reduced significantly from 37% ± 20.7% during the preintervention period to 19.4% ± 14.3% during the postintervention period (P < 0.001). Conclusion: Our study demonstrated a significant reduction in sepsis mortality after the implementation of the SSC care bundles. Early diagnosis of the disease, optimum hemodynamic resuscitation, and timely antibiotic administration are the key elements of sepsis management.']"

Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) with multi-segmental BD is technically challenging. ERCP with percutaneous biliary drainage (PTBD) or PTBD alone has cumbersome maintenance of PTBD line and external bag. The utility of EUS-guided BD (EUS-BD) has risen significantly over last 5 years mostly in the clinical setting of distal bile duct obstruction. Information on EUS-BD for malignant hilar biliary obstruction (MHBO) is thus far limited to only two small studies. This review suggests a new concept of a combination of ERCP and EUS-BD (CERES) for BD in MHBO as a primary BD method whereby ERCP with a single self-expandable metal stent (SEMS) is placed into either the right or the left intrahepatic bile duct (IHD). If SEMS is placed in the right biliary system, EUS-guided hepaticogastrostomy (EUS-HGS) can subsequently be carried out. However, if the stent is placed into the left biliary system, EUS-guided hepaticoduodenostomy (EUS-HDS) is done. For MHBO with non-functioning right lobe of the liver, EUS-HGS is carried out after failed ERCP, or primary HGS can be carried out in the left lobe of liver. For MHBO with non-functioning left lobe of the liver, EUS-HDS is carried out after failed transpapillary stenting of the right lobe by ERCP. Based on our experience, CERES is promising as it can fulfil gaps of both PTBD and ERCP by allowing internal drainage that can circumvent the inconvenience associated with PTBD and offer higher technical success rate compared to ERCP with bilateral SEMS placement.', ""Efficacy and safety of EUS biliary drainage in malignant distal and hilar biliary obstruction: A comprehensive review of literature and algorithm  2020 Spring Media.

This can be divided into malignant hilar biliary obstruction (MHBO) or malignant distal biliary obstruction (MDBO) biliary obstruction to which clinical outcomes and technical considerations of various biliary drainage methods may differ. EUS biliary drainage (EUS-BD) has been increasingly influential in the management of MBO together with other familiar biliary drainage methods such as ERCP and percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage (PTBD). Conventionally, ERCP has always been the primary choice of endoscopic biliary drainage in both MHBO and MDBO and that PTBD or EUS-BD is used as a salvage method when ERCP fails for which current guidelines recommends PTBD, especially for MHBO. This review was able to show that with today's evidence, EUS-BD is equally efficacious and possesses a better safety profile in the management of MBO and should be on the forefront of endoscopic biliary drainage. Therefore, EUS-BD could be used either as a primary or preferred salvage biliary drainage method in these cases."", 'ERCP plus endoscopic ultrasound-guided biliary drainage versus percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage for malignant hilar biliary obstruction: A multicenter observational open-label study  2021 Georg Thieme Verlag.

Complete biliary drainage is accomplished by adding percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage (PTBD). We prospectively compared recurrent biliary obstruction (RBO) rates between combined ERCP and endoscopic ultrasound-guided biliary drainage (EUS-BD) vs. bilateral PTBD. Methods Patients with MHBO undergoing endoscopic procedures (group A) were compared with those undergoing bilateral PTBD (group B). The primary outcome was the 3-month RBO rate. Results 36 patients were recruited into groups A (n = 19) and B (n = 17). Rates of technical and clinical success, and complications of group A vs. B were 84.2 % (16/19) vs. 100 % (17/17; P = 0.23), 78.9 % (15/19) vs. 76.5 % (13/17; P > 0.99), and 26.3 % (5/19) vs. 35.3 % (6/17; P = 0.56), respectively. Within 3 and 6 months, RBO rates of group A vs. group B were 26.7 % (4/15) vs. 88.2 % (15/17; P = 0.001) and 22.2 % (2/9) vs. 100 % (9/9; P = 0.002), respectively. At 3 months, median number of biliary reinterventions in group A was significantly lower than in group B (0 [interquartile range] 0-1 vs. 1 [1-2.5]), respectively (P < 0.001). Median time to development of RBO was longer in group A than in group B (92 [56-217] vs. 40 [13.5-57.8] days, respectively; P = 0.06).

This study focused on mothers who were engaged in farm tasks and had children between the ages of 0 to 72 months, with the objective of reducing pesticide exposure. Methods: This study was conducted from May 2020 to October 2020 in the Ban Fa and Ban Phi sub-districts in Ban Luang due to the high use of pesticides in these areas. A systematic random sampling technique was used to recruit 78 mothers exposed to pesticides. Thirty-nine mothers from Ban Fa district were randomly assigned to the intervention group and 39 from Ban Phi to the control group over a 3-month period. This study applied a pesticide behavioral change training program for the intervention group. To assess the effectiveness of the program, the study compared the results of a questionnaire regarding knowledge, attitude, and practice (KAP) and health beliefs related to pesticide exposure as well as the levels of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyryl cholinesterase (BChE) enzymes, biomarkers of exposure to pesticides, before and after the intervention using ANCOVA statistical test. Furthermore, to evaluate the effectiveness of the intervention program, a paired t-test was used to investigate the in-home pesticide safety assessment. Results: After the intervention, we observed no significant change in AChE; however, a significant improvement in BChE (p < 0.05), a marker of short-term recovery, was observed. Pesticides can cause a reduction in AChE and BChE, however, after eliminating pesticides, BChE takes a shorter time (about 30–50 days) to recover than AChE (around 90–120 days). Therefore, increases in the measured concentrations of AChE and/or BChE suggest the presence of less chemicals from pesticides in the human body. The study also found a significant improvement in KAP and beliefs about chemical pesticide exposure after the intervention (p < 0.05). Furthermore, using a paired t-test, we found a significant increase in pesticide safety practices (p < 0.05) in the intervention group and a borderline significant increase regarding in-home safety (p = 0.051) in the control group. Conclusions: Based on the results, the constructs of the intervention program were effective and could be applied in other agricultural areas in less developed countries. However, due to time limitations during the COVID-19 pandemic, further studies should be conducted to enable data collection over a longer time, with a larger number of subjects providing the ChE levels for the non-agricultural season.', 'Knowledge, attitude and practice of pesticide use and serum cholinesterase levels among rice farmers in Nakhon Nayok Province, Thailand  2019, Sapsatree Santaweesuk, Paisit Boonyakawee and Wattasit Siriwong.Purpose: The study purposes were to investigate the knowledge, attitude and practice of pesticide use and to determine the levels of serum cholinesterase among rice farmers in Nakhon Nayok province, Thailand. Design/methodology/approach: A cross-sectional study was carried out in communities in Nakhon Nayok Province, Thailand. Multistage random sampling was employed, selecting one person per each rice farmer household. Data was collected from 188 rice farmers using a structured face-to-face interview questionnaire. A reactive-paper finger-blood test was used to determine SChE levels. Chi-square test was used to determine the relationship between the practice of pesticide use and SChE levels. Findings: The results indicated that the rice farmers had a fairly good knowledge and a neutral attitude toward the practice of pesticide use. Most of the respondents had a fairly proper practice of pesticide use. However, serum cholinesterase levels of the farmers were unsafe and risky. It signified that 68.1% of the farmers had a health risk from using pesticides. The prevalence of abnormal SChE levels among rice farmers with improper use was significantly higher than that among rice farmers who had a proper use. Research limitations/implications: The result provided a guideline for operational planning and control and prevention of health effects from pesticides use in farmers or other agriculturists who use pesticides in cultivation. Practical implications: Concerned local agencies especially health-related agencies are able to conduct a training to educate and build safety awareness including monitoring continuously the safety behaviors toward pesticides use. It can be implemented by establishing leaders from health promoting hospitals led by village health volunteers, community leaders and participation from farmers to collaboratively monitor proper use of pesticides beginning with health surveillance in the abnormal SChE group to be screened for pesticide exposure every six months or one year. Social implications: Farmers gained knowledge and understanding of pesticides use and used it properly, which resulted in a reduction of pesticide residues in body as well as in the environment. In addition, the government policy should legislate measures for related agencies to promote proper use of pesticides. For instance, Department of Agriculture, Minister of Agriculture and Cooperatives should regularly supervise, monitor and inspect the production and distribution of pesticides in local shops and also systematically encourage agriculturists to adopt using pesticides that are less harmful. Originality/value: Having knowledge, understanding and proper practices toward pesticides use, farmers can reduce health effects of pesticides use in themselves and family members.', 'The effects of a pesticide application program on improving knowledge and attitude related to pesticide use: A quasi-experimental study among rice farmers in Thailand  2021, Mahidol University - ASEAN Institute for Health Development.

This study aimed to evaluate the effects of an application program on improving knowledge and attitude related to pesticide use among rice farmers in Ongkharak, Nakhon Nayok Province, Thailand. In this quasi-experimental study, two communities in different sub-districts were randomly selected for the intervention and the control groups. The inclusion criteria were 45–59-year-old rice farmers involved in the entire process of growing rice that was related to pesticide use. Multistage random sampling was employed by selecting one rice farmer from each rice farmer’s household. Of these, 37 farmers each were assigned to the intervention group and the control group, respectively. The data were collected at the baseline and four months after the intervention. A structured face-to-face interview questionnaire was administered to the participants. The pesticide application program was based on observation learning under the social cognitive theory and consisted of three elements over a three-month period: (1) knowledge and training, (2) risk communication, and (3) health surveillance. The intervention effect was assessed by measuring 1) the participants’ knowledge on the safe use of pesticides and 2) their attitude related to pesticide use. The general linear model repeated-measure analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to generate figures by group and time. The pesticide application program had effectively improved the intervention group members’ knowledge on the safe use of pesticides and their attitude related to pesticide use at follow-up compared with the mean score at the baseline. Future studies should focus on the health effects of using pesticides on elderly rice farmers and vulnerable groups, as well as include programs that can sustainably reduce the health risks from their pesticide use.']"

Altered gene expression and methylation profiles have been reported in various tissues and cell lines from individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). However, the role of Alu elements in ASD remains unclear. We thus investigated whether Alu elements are associated with altered gene expression profiles in ASD. Methods: We obtained five blood-based gene expression profiles from the Gene Expression Omnibus database and human Alu-inserted gene lists from the TranspoGene database. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in ASD were identified from each study and overlapped with the human Alu-inserted genes. The biological functions and networks of Alu-inserted DEGs were then predicted by Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA). A combined bisulfite restriction analysis of lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) derived from 36 ASD and 20 sex- and age-matched unaffected individuals was performed to assess the global DNA methylation levels within Alu elements, and the Alu expression levels were determined by quantitative RT-PCR. Results: In ASD blood or blood-derived cells, 320 Alu-inserted genes were reproducibly differentially expressed. Biological function and pathway analysis showed that these genes were significantly associated with neurodevelopmental disorders and neurological functions involved in ASD etiology. Interestingly, estrogen receptor and androgen signaling pathways implicated in the sex bias of ASD, as well as IL-6 signaling and neuroinflammation signaling pathways, were also highlighted. Alu methylation was not significantly different between the ASD and sex- and age-matched control groups. However, significantly altered Alu methylation patterns were observed in ASD cases sub-grouped based on Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised scores compared with matched controls. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis of Alu expression also showed significant differences between ASD subgroups. Interestingly, Alu expression was correlated with methylation status in one phenotypic ASD subgroup. Conclusion: Alu methylation and expression were altered in LCLs from ASD subgroups. Our findings highlight the association of Alu elements with gene dysregulation in ASD blood samples and warrant further investigation. Moreover, the classification of ASD individuals into subgroups based on phenotypes may be beneficial and could provide insights into the still unknown etiology and the underlying mechanisms of ASD.', 'Role of the immune system in autism spectrum disorders (ASD)  2018 Bentham Science Publishers.Background: The evidence based supports that multifactorial and complex immune interactions play a role in autism spectrum disorders (ASD), but contradictory findings are also reported. Objective: The aim of this selective review was to identify trends in the research literature on this topic, focusing on immunology and other aberrations with respect to the different ASD subtypes. Methods: This selective review is based on original and review articles written in English and identified in literature searches of PubMed. Results: Several studies have found that the risk of ASD is greater among children whose mothers suffered from autoimmune diseases while pregnant. Moreover, individuals with ASD show increased levels of antibodies that are specific for several specific proteins. Studies also show that mothers of children with ASD have antibodies against fetal brain proteins. There are also reports on the associations between increased levels of proinflammatory cytokines and ASD. Finally, infections in mothers during pregnancy are linked to an increased risk of ASD. Conclusion: We propose that the large inconsistencies in findings among studies in the field are due to differences in subdiagnoses among the included children with ASD. Well-phenotyped ASD samples are needed to understand the biological and immunological mechanisms underpinning ASD and its subdiagnoses. Future research should apply new strategies to scrutinize the link between ASD and changes in immune responsivity. Important new research avenues are to investigate the associations (a) between different ASD phenotypes and aberrations in (auto)immune pathways and (b) between reduced natural regulatory autoimmune responses during pregnancy, which are in turn associated with increased oxidative and nitrosative stress in maternal blood and putative detrimental effects in the offspring.', 'Sex Differences in the Effects of Prenatal Bisphenol A Exposure on Genes Associated with Autism Spectrum Disorder in the Hippocampus  2019, The Author(s).Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder inexplicably biased towards males. Although prenatal exposure to bisphenol A (BPA) has recently been associated with the ASD risk, whether BPA dysregulates ASD-related genes in the developing brain remains unclear. In this study, transcriptome profiling by RNA-seq analysis of hippocampi isolated from neonatal pups prenatally exposed to BPA was conducted and revealed a list of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) associated with ASD. Among the DEGs, several ASD candidate genes, including Auts2 and Foxp2, were dysregulated and showed sex differences in response to BPA exposure. The interactome and pathway analyses of DEGs using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis software revealed significant associations between the DEGs in males and neurological functions/disorders associated with ASD. Moreover, the reanalysis of transcriptome profiling data from previously published BPA studies consistently showed that BPA-responsive genes were significantly associated with ASD-related genes. The findings from this study indicate that prenatal BPA exposure alters the expression of ASD-linked genes in the hippocampus and suggest that maternal BPA exposure may increase ASD susceptibility by dysregulating genes associated with neurological functions known to be negatively impacted in ASD, which deserves further investigations.']"

Ten dairy goats were selected and divided into two groups, five animals each. Animals received either control DCAD (control, 22.81 mEq/100 g dry matter (DM)) or high DCAD (DCAD, 39.08 mEq/100 g DM). The results indicated that rectal temperature (Tr), respiration rate, milk yield and compositions did not differ between groups. But the percentage change of Tr from the DCAD group was lower than the control group between 09.00 and 13.00 hours. DM intake tended to increase in the DCAD group. Dairy goats in the DCAD group drank more water, but urinary excretion and plasma antidiuretic hormone concentration remained unchanged. Apparent water balance was higher from the DCAD group over 24 h. There was no effect of DCAD on plasma and blood volumes, but tended to increase in extracellular fluid and thereby increased total body water. The present results indicate that animals supplemented with high DCAD increase their total body water and apparent water balance. These results have contributed to the process of adaptation for evaporative cooling and would be useful in slowing down the elevation in Tr.', 'High Dietary Cation and Anion Difference and High-Dose Ascorbic Acid Modify Acid–Base and Antioxidant Balance in Dairy Goats Fed under Tropical Conditions  2023 by the authors.High ambient temperature (HTa) causes acid–base imbalance and systemic oxidative stress, and this may indirectly affect the mammary gland. Furthermore, HTa induces intracellular oxidative stress, which has been proposed to affect cell metabolism directly. We previously showed in dairy goats that the negative effect of HTa was compromised by enhancing heat dissipation during a high dietary cation and anion difference (DCAD) regimen. Moreover, high-dose vitamin C or ascorbic acid (AA) supplements have been used to manage oxidative stress in ruminants. The present study hypothesized that high DCAD and AA supplements that could alleviate the HTa effect would influence the milk synthesis pathway and mammary gland function. The results showed that goats fed with high DCAD had higher blood pH than control goats in the 4th week. The high dose of AA supplement decreases urine pH in the 8th week. The percent reduction of urine pH from the AA supplement was significant in the DCAD group. The high-dose AA supplement decreased plasma glutathione peroxidase activity and malonaldehyde. This effect was enhanced by a high DCAD supplement. In addition, supplementation with AA increased milk protein and citrate and decreased milk FFA. These alterations indicate the intracellular biochemical pathway of energy metabolism and milk synthesis. It can be concluded that a high DCAD regimen and AA supplement in dairy goats fed under HTa could influence the milk synthesis pathway. The evidence suggests that HTa decreases mammary gland function by modification of acid–base homeostasis and oxidative stress.', 'The effect of dietary ions difference on drinking and eating patterns in dairy goats under high ambient temperature Copyright  2019 by Asian-Australasian Journal of Animal Sciences.Objective: The present study was carried out to evaluate the effect of high dietary cation and anion difference (DCAD) rations on diurnal variations in eating and meal patterns, water intake and urination patterns in dairy goats fed under high ambient temperature (HTa). Methods: Ten crossbred dairy goats during peri-parturition period were selected and divided into two groups of five animals each. Experimental diets were control DCAD (control, 22.8 mEq/100 g dry matter [DM]) and high DCAD (DCAD, 39.1 mEq/100 g DM). The composition of two diets consisted of 44% corn silage and 56% concentrate. From the 2nd week to 8th week postpartum, goats were fed ad libitum twice daily either with the control or DCAD total mix ration with free access to water. The spontaneous eating and drinking patterns were determined. Results: The environmental conditions in the present experiment indicated that goats were fed under HTa conditions (average peak THI = 85.2) and were in heat stress. In addition to the typical HTa induced tachypnoea in both groups, the respiratory rate in the DCAD group was significantly higher than the control group (p<0.05). Although the goats from both groups showed comparable level of eating, drinking and urination during experiment, the meal pattern and water intake were different. High DCAD apparently increased eating and meal patterns compared with the control. At week 8 postpartum, goats from high DCAD group had significant (p<0.05) bigger meal size and longer meal duration. Moreover, high DCAD appeared to increase night-time water intake (p<0.05). Conclusion: Both meal pattern and night-time drinking effects of DCAD suggested that feeding with high DCAD ration may alleviate the effect of heat stress in dairy goat fed under HTa conditions.']"

Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.A chronic kidney disease (CKD) causes uremic toxin accumulation and gut dysbiosis, which further induces gut leakage and worsening CKD. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) of Gram‐negative bacteria and (1à3)‐β‐D‐glucan (BG) of fungi are the two most abundant gut microbial molecules. Due to limited data on the impact of intestinal fungi in CKD mouse models, the influences of gut fungi and Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus L34 (L34) on CKD were investigated using oral C. albicans-administered 5/6 nephrectomy (5/6Nx) mice. At 16 weeks post‐5/6Nx, Candida‐5/6Nx mice demonstrated an increase in proteinuria, serum BG, serum cytokines (tumor necrotic factor‐α; TNF‐α and interleukin‐6), alanine transaminase (ALT), and level of fecal dysbiosis (Proteobacteria on fecal microbiome) when compared to non‐Candida‐5/6Nx. However, serum creatinine, renal fibrosis, or gut barrier defect (FITC‐dextran assay and endotoxemia) remained comparable between Candida‐ versus non‐Candida‐5/6Nx. The probiotics L34 attenuated several parameters in Candida‐5/6Nx mice, including fecal dysbiosis (Proteobacteria and Bacteroides), gut leakage (fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)‐dextran), gut‐derived uremic toxin (trimethylamine‐N‐oxide; TMAO) and indoxyl sulfate; IS), cytokines, and ALT. In vitro, IS combined with LPS with or without BG enhanced the injury on Caco‐2 enterocytes (transepithelial electrical resistance and FITC‐dextran permeability) and bone marrow‐derived macrophages (supernatant cytokines (TNF‐α and interleukin‐1 β; IL‐1β) and inflammatory genes (TNF‐α, IL‐1β, aryl hydrocarbon receptor, and nuclear factor‐κB)), compared with non‐IS activation. These injuries were attenuated by the probiotics condition media. In conclusion, Candida administration worsens kidney damage in 5/6Nx mice through systemic inflammation, partly from gut dysbiosis‐induced uremic toxins, which were attenuated by the probiotics. The additive effects on cell injury from uremic toxin (IS) and microbial molecules (LPS and BG) on enterocytes and macrophages might be an important underlying mechanism.', 'Candida Administration Worsens Cecal Ligation and Puncture-Induced Sepsis in Obese Mice Through Gut Dysbiosis Enhanced Systemic Inflammation, Impact of Pathogen-Associated Molecules From Gut Translocation and Saturated Fatty Acid  Copyright  2020 Panpetch, Sawaswong, Chanchaem, Ondee, Dang, Payungporn and Leelahavanichkul.Obesity induces gut leakage and elevates serum lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a major cell wall component of Gram-negative bacteria, through gut translocation. Because Candida albicans is prominent in human gut but not in mouse, C. albicans, a source of (1→3)-β-D-glucan (BG) in gut contents, was administered in high-fat diet (HFD)–induced obese mice at 1 week before sepsis induction by cecal ligation and puncture (CLP). As such, sepsis in Candida-administered obese mice was more severe than obese mice without Candida as determined by mortality, organ injury (liver and kidney), serum cytokines, gut leakage, endotoxemia, serum BG, and fecal Gram-negative bacteria (microbiome analysis). Mice subjected to CLP and fed a HFD, but not treated with Candida demonstrated a similar mortality to non-obese mice with more severe gut leakage and higher serum cytokines. In vitro experiments demonstrated that LPS plus BG (LPS + BG) induced higher supernatant cytokines from hepatocytes (HepG2) and macrophages (RAW264.7), compared with the activation by each molecule alone, and were amplified by palmitic acid, a representative saturated fatty acid. The energy production capacity of HepG2 cells was also decreased by LPS + BG compared with LPS alone as evaluated by extracellular flux analysis. However, Lactobacillus rhamnosus L34 (L34) improved sepsis, regardless of Candida administration, through the attenuation of gut leakage and gut dysbiosis. In conclusion, an impact of gut Candida was demonstrated by Candida pretreatment in obese mice that worsened sepsis through (1) gut dysbiosis–induced gut leakage and (2) amplified systemic inflammation due to LPS, BG, and saturated fatty acid.', 'Additional Candida albicans administration enhances the severity of dextran sulfate solution induced colitis mouse model through leaky gut-enhanced systemic inflammation and gut-dysbiosis but attenuated by Lactobacillus rhamnosus L34  2019,  2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.Candida albicans: is abundant in the human gut mycobiota but this species does not colonize the mouse gastrointestinal tract. C. albicans administration in dextran-sulfate solution (DSS) induced-colitis mouse model (DSS+Candida) might resemble more to human condition, therefore, a DSS colitis model with Candida administration was studied; first, to test the influence of fungi in DSS model and second, to test the efficacy of Lactobacillus rhamnosus L34. We demonstrated serum (1→3)-β-D-glucan (BG) elevation in patients with IBD and endoscopic moderate colitis in clinical remission, supporting the possible influence of gut fungi toward IBD in human. Then, in mouse model, Candida gavage was found to worsen the DSS model indicated by higher mortality rate, more severe colon histology and enhanced gut-leakage (FITC-dextran assay, endotoxemia, serum BG and blood bacterial burdens) but did not affect weight loss and diarrhea. DSS+Candida induced higher pro-inflammatory cytokines both in blood and in intestinal tissue. Worsened systemic pro-inflammatory cytokine responses in DSS+Candida compared with DSS alone was possibly due to the more severe translocation of LPS, BG and bacteria (not fungemia) from gut into systemic circulation. Interestingly, bacteremia from Pseudomonas aeruginosa was more frequently isolated from DSS+Candida than DSS alone. In parallel, P. aeruginosa was also isolated from fecal culture in most of the mice in DSS+Candida group supported by prominent Gammaproteobacteria in fecal microbioata analysis. However, L. rhamnosus L34 attenuated both DSS+Candida and DSS model through the attenuation of gut local inflammation (cytokines and histology), gut-leakage severity, fecal dysbiosis (culture method and microbiome analysis) and systemic inflammation (serum cytokines). In conclusion, gut Candida in DSS model induced fecal bacterial dysbiosis and enhanced leaky-gut induced bacteremia. Probiotic treatment strategy aiming to reduce gut-fungi and fecal dysbiosis could attenuate disease severity. Investigation on gut fungi in patients with IBD is highly interesting.']"

Here, we demonstrate that an incorporation of zinc-aluminium layered double hydroxides (ZnAl-LDH) into PDA assemblies via a simple mixing process promotes local interactions, yielding reversible thermochromism. The Zn2+ ions, released from ZnAl-LDH particles, play an essential role on achieving this phenomenon. X-ray diffraction and infrared spectroscopy reveal that the Zn2+ ions intercalate with PDA bilayer and strongly interact with carboxylate headgroup. Color-transition temperature of the nanocomposites can be tuned from 50 to 90 °C by varying the alkyl side chain of PDA. Furthermore, the reversible thermochromism persists in various organic solvents, allowing the utilization in smart paints and coating technologies. Compared to the previous studies of other PDA/LDH nanocomposites, our new materials exhibit more distinct color transition. The synthetic method is also much simpler. The new nanocomposites are more stable at low or high pH regions compared to the system of PDA/Zn2+/ZnO nanocomposite, expanding new routes for fabrication and applications in harsh conditions.', 'Reversible thermochromic polydiacetylene/Zn(II) ion assemblies prepared via co-assembling in aqueous phase: The essential role of pH  2020 Elsevier B.V.Reversible thermochromism of polydiacetylene/zinc(II) ion (PDA/Zn2+ assemblies is achieved via co-assembling process in an aqueous medium. Our preparation method is quite easy compared to other previous reports. Diacetylene monomer, 1012-pentacosadiynoic acid PCDA, and ZnCl2 are simply mixed in water followed by an incubation in a refrigerator and then UV light irradiation. The resultant assemblies prepared using normal conditions (pH 6.5) exhibits partially reversible themochromism. Hydroxide ion (OH−) is a key component for promoting strong interaction between PCDA carboxylate headgroup and Zn2+ ions during the self-assembling process. We have found that increasing the pH above 8 yields fully reversible thermochromism. The reversible blue-to-purple color transition occurs at about 75 °C. X-ray diffraction reveals the Zn2+-intercalated bilayer structure while infrared spectroscopy probes strong interactions within the assemblies. The PCDA/Zn2+ mole ratio is also a very important parameter for achieving reversible thermochromism. An ability to prepare the PDA/Zn2+ assemblies in aqueous suspension allows the fabrication of solid-state colorimetric sensors by drop-casting on a glass slide, writing on a paper or incorporating into a polyvinylalcohol film. The reversible color-transition temperature can be tuned to about 40 °C by shortening the alkyl chain of constituent PDA. Our new approach for preparing the reversible thermochromic PDA-based materials is quite easy and can be utilized for large scale production of colorimetric sensor, smart ink or paint.', 'Synthesis of color-responsive polydiacetylene assemblies and polydiacetylene/zinc(II) ion/zinc oxide nanocomposites in water, toluene and mixed solvents: Toward large-scale production  2021 Elsevier B.V.Polydiacetylenes (PDAs) are well-known materials that can be utilized as colorimetric sensors of various stimuli. PDA-based materials are normally synthesized via a self-assembly in an aqueous medium. In this study, we explored important experimental parameters including concentration, incubating temperature, and solvent media, that affected the self-assembly of monocarboxylic PDA and reversible thermochromic PDA/Zn2+/ZnO nanocomposites. The critical concentration (C*), the lowest concentration for topotactic photopolymerization in each system, was determined. We achieved, for the first time, direct synthesis of PDA/Zn2+/ZnO nanocomposites in toluene. Furthermore, it was possible to synthesize the nanocomposites at ambient conditions, simplifying the process for large-scale production. The addition of co-solvent, ethanol, resulted in a significant increase in blue-phase concentration. The presence of ethanol in the solvent medium also caused the morphological change from sheet-like to ribbon-like structures. The ability to synthesize the nanocomposite in nonpolar media allowed the fabrication of solid-state sensors by mixing with various polymers such as polyethylene, polystyrene, poly(methyl methacrylate), and poly(4-vinylpyridine). Reversible thermochromic smart inks were prepared by simple mixing with acrylic paint. Our study extends the utilization of PDA-based materials as colorimetric sensors.']"

Co-pyrolysis of RWS and OPT was performed at the mixing ratio of 50:50 (wt.). The biomass samples were pyrolyzed at temperatures of 400, 450, and 500 °C under specific conditions. The results indicated that the yields of the bio-oil, biochar and pyrolysis gas were in the ranges of 38.5-46.5, 22.27-28.68 and 30.1-36.9 wt.%, respectively. Pyrolysis of RWS at 500 °C provided the most bio-oil. Co-pyrolysis of RWS and OPT could improve the product yield and quality. The bio-oil had relatively high water content, while its pH was low. The main compounds of bio-oil were oxygenated compounds such as acetic acid, phenols and 2-Propanone, 1-hydroxy-, determined by GC-MS. The higher heating value (HHV) of bio-oil ranged from 16.1 to 20.36 MJ/kg. The biochar had high carbon content and low oxygen content in proximate and ultimate analysis, and based on FTIR. The HHV of biochar was in the range from 26.35 to 29.6 MJ/kg. The biochar also was highly porous, which was revealed by SEM and BET. The pyrolysis gas mainly contained CO, CO2, H2 and CH4, and its heating value was in the range from 3.23 to 6.7 MJ/m3. Based on these results, the RWS and OPT are alternative and challenging biomasses for conversion to biofuels and value-added products via pyrolysis.', 'Optimization of Lignin Extraction from Pine Wood for Fast Pyrolysis by Using a γ-Valerolactone-Based Binary Solvent System  2019 American Chemical Society. Fast pyrolysis of lignin is a promising method to produce aromatic chemicals and fuels. Lignin structure and pyrolysis conditions determine the liquid yield and product selectivity. Extraction of pine wood using γ-valerolactone (GVL) mixed with water in the presence of diluted sulfuric acid obtains lignin (GVL-lignin) which shows different product yield and selectivity. The composition of the extraction medium influences the yield of GVL-lignin and affects its native structure. The GVL-to-water ratio affects the lignin yield without significantly modifying the structure of the extracted lignin, whereas the sulfuric acid concentration affects both the extraction yield and the extracted lignin structure. These structural changes influence the product distribution after fast pyrolysis, which generates phenols and alkoxy phenols as the main products in the liquid fraction. Lignin extracted with a mixture of 4/1 of GVL/H 2 O (w/w) and 0.075 M sulfuric acid solution produces the highest pyrolysis liquid yield. Pyrolysis of GVL-lignin at 750 °C generates the maximum liquid yield. The amount of phenols in fast pyrolysis products increases with increasing temperature and sulfuric acid concentration used in the GVL-lignin extraction. This indicates that the extraction conditions of GVL-lignin may be optimized to increase the selectivity in fast pyrolysis.', 'Phenol-derived products from fast pyrolysis of organosolv lignin  2020 The Author(s)Lignin is the largest aromatic bio-polymer feedstock with a huge potential of being refined for aromatic chemical platform and building block. Organosolv process for lignin extraction has a low impact on the environment due to its low chemical requirement, the absence of sulfur, and as it is more practical for chemical recovery. Therefore, refinement of extracted lignin to valuable molecular compounds such as purified lignin and its derivative is the key success for biorefinery industry. In this study, sugarcane bagasse from a local sugar manufacturer in Thailand, noted as BG-lignin, was selected as feedstock for lignin extraction using ethanol and water. The chemical composition of this lignin was slightly different than that of commercially available organosolv lignin, noted as Comm-OS-lignin, in that BG-lignin has more combustible constituents (volatile organic compounds and fixed carbon) of 96.14% and low ash content of 0.09%. The chemical structure of BG-lignin contains a higher number of aliphatic hydrocarbon and aliphatic hydroxy side chains than Comm-OS-lignin, as confirmed by the FT-IR and 1H-NMR analyses. The study on fast pyrolysis of lignin, using Py-GCMS technique, found 2, 3-dihydrobenzofuran as a major constituent at any tested pyrolysis temperature. H-unit, G-unit, and S-unit are distributed in resemble fraction with a H∕G∕S ratio of 1∕1∕0.7 and 0.8∕1∕1 for Comm-OS-lignin and BG-lignin, respectively, at pyrolysis temperature of 400–600 °C, except for H-unit which was enhanced at 700 °C to 28.82% of Comm-OS-lignin and 29.66% of BG-lignin. At a temperature of 400–600 °C, phenolic selectivity of pyrolyzed products, mainly methoxy phenol (Ph-OCH3) and alkylated phenol (R-Ph-OCH3), was done. A higher pyrolysis temperature of 700 °C led to the elimination of aromatic side group and is more favorable in alkyl phenol (R-Ph) and phenol selectivity. However, reduction of the phenolic compound was observed with a higher temperature due to thermal fragmentation of the C–C linkage in the aromatic structure. Products selectivity related to lignin feedstock and pyrolysis temperature could be applied as a conceptual guideline for conducting further study of chemical upgrading process to obtain high-value biochemical products.']"

Gaining a better understanding of the dynamics of the microbial community during the acclimation period in the system could be useful for the development of mature nitrifying biofilters. In this study, high-throughput DNA sequencing was applied to monitor the microbial communities on a biofilter during the acclimation period (7 weeks) in high (100 mg N/L) and low (5 mg N/L) total ammonia nitrogen (TAN) treatments. Both treatments were successful for developing a mature nitrifying biofilter, dominated by Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and Nitrospirae. Complete nitrification was found after 7 days of biofilter acclimation as indicated by decreasing TAN concentration, increasing nitrate concentration, and high abundances of the nitrifying bacteria, Nitrosomonadaceae and Nitrospiraceae. The beta diversity analysis of microbial communities showed different clustering of the samples between high and low TAN treatment groups. A greater abundance of nitrifying bacteria was found in the high TAN treatments (27–51%) than in the low TAN treatment (15–29%). The bacterial diversity in biofilters acclimated at high TAN concentration (Shannon’s index 5.40–6.15) were lower than those found at low TAN treatment levels (Shannon’s index 6.40–7.01). The higher diversity in biofilters acclimated at low TAN concentrations, consisting of Planctomycetes and Archaea, might benefit the nutrient recycling in the system. Although nitrification activity was observed from the first week of the acclimation period, the acclimation period should be taken as at least 6 weeks for full development of nitrifying biofilm. Moreover, the reduction of potentially pathogenic Vibrio on biofilters was found at that period.', 'Design and function of a nitrogen and sediment removal system in a recirculating aquaculture system optimized for aquaponics  2021 Korean Society of Environmental Engineers.Aquaponic systems (APSs) are based upon the sustainable utilization of nitrogen and phosphorus from a recirculating aquaculture system (RAS) as the nutrient source for plant production. Since the proper management of nitrogen and suspended solids are important for nutrient utilization efficiency, their optimization was evaluated. The RAS integrated with filtration unit and nitrifying biofilter provided complete nitrification without solid accumulation. Under the optimal treatment condition for 16 d, the treated water was low in ammonia (0 mg-N/L) and high in nitrate (> 6 mg-N/L) concentrations, which was appropriate for use in the cultivation of lettuce (Lactuca sativa). The RAS was then incorporated with hydroponics at a 5:1 fish: plant weight ratio. Moreover, the simplified APS was compared with a typical APS system that incorporated filtration unit and nitrifying biofilter. The natural growth of nitrifying microorganisms in the simplified APS could perform complete nitrification after 20 d of operation giving low ammonia and nitrite concentrations. The nutrient removal efficiency of the simplified APS resembled the typical system. During the aquaponics, the hydroponic unit in the aquaculture system was sufficient to control the nutrient concentrations within the appropriate levels for fish cultivation, i.e. nitrate (< 20 mg-N/L) and phosphate (< 3 mg-P/L).', 'Use of an internal fibrous biofilter for intermittent nitrification and denitrification treatments in a zero-discharge shrimp culture tank  2019 Elsevier B.V.To achieve water reuse in recirculating aquaculture systems, intermittent nitrification and denitrification processes using internal fibrous media was proposed. A pre-acclimated Biocord biofilter, with an initial nitrification rate of 17.1 ± 12.4 mg total ammonia nitrogen-N/m2/d was applied in a marine whiteleg shrimp (Litopenaeus vannamei) culture tank. Throughout the experiment, the aerobic nitrification activity of the biofilter was sufficient to control the ammonia and nitrite levels below 0.2 mg-N/L with an accumulation of nitrate up to 50 mg-N/L. The remaining nitrate was successfully removed after shrimp harvest with the same biofilter through anoxic denitrification in conjunction with a methanol supplement at a chemical oxygen demand: nitrate-N ratio of 5:1. With complete nitrogen removal, the water was re-aerated and the next crop of shrimp culture was initiated. In this study, a two-crop shrimp cultivation was performed in sequence in the same tank without water exchange. The microbial diversity was monitored using high-throughput sequencing on Illumina MiSeq, which demonstrated that Proteobacteria (45.3 %), Chloroflexi (18.4 %), and Bacteroidetes (17.1 %) were the most abundant phyla. With an emphasis on nitrogen removal, the family Nitrosomonadaceae and Nitrospiraceae were the dominant nitrifying bacteria during the aerobic nitrification, while a high relative abundance of the Methylophaga and Methylotenera genera was observed under the anoxic condition.']"

In this work, methyl palmitate (palmitic acid methyl ester) having a melting point around 30℃, was used as a model solid non-particulate (waxy) soil. A total surfactant concentration of 0.35 wt% of the selected formulation (4:0.65 weight ratio of C12,13-4PO-SO4Na:SMDNS) with 5.3 wt% NaCl was able to form a middle phase microemulsion at a high temperature (40℃),which provided the highest oil removal level with the lowest oil redeposition and the lowest IFT, and was much higher than that with a commercial detergent or de-ionized water. Most of the detached oil, whether in liquid or solid state, was in an unsolubilized form. Hence, the dispersion stability of the detached oil droplets or solidified oil particles that resulted from the surfactant adsorption played an important role in the oil redeposition. For an oily detergency, the lower the system IFT, the higher the oil removal whereas for a waxy (non-particulate) soil detergency, the lower the contact angle, the higher the solidified oil removal. For a liquefied oil, the detergency mechanism was roll up and emulsification with dispersion stability, while that for the waxy soil (solid oil) was the detachment by wettability with dispersion stability.', 'Application of Hydrophilic–Lipophilic Deviation Equations to the Formulation of a Mixed-Surfactant Washing Agent for Crude Rice Bran Oil Removal from Spent Bleaching Earth  2021 AOCS.In Thailand, spent bleaching earth (SBE) (20–40 wt.% remaining oil), an industrial waste from edible oil refineries, has usually been disposed of by improper landfilling at industrial sites. This study aims to formulate microemulsion-based washing solutions from mixed surfactants for cleaning SBE contaminated with crude rice bran oil using the hydrophilic–lipophilic deviation (HLD) concept. Binary nonionic-anionic surfactant mixtures consisting of System A (Dehydol LS3TH-Levenol WX), System B (Dehydol LS5TH-Levenol WX), and System C (Dehydol LS7TH-Levenol WX) were formulated for use as microemulsion-based washing formulations. A HLDmixed equation extended with the excess free energy term (GEX/RT) was developed and proposed for predicting the optimum salinity. The optimum salinities obtained from the HLDmixed equation were close to those obtained from the phase behavior. In the SBE washing study, the mixed-surfactant systems showed a washing efficiency of 90% with low surfactant adsorption capacity on bleaching earth (qmax = 0.01–0.03 mol g−1). The mixed surfactants showed improved washing performance compared to that of the single-surfactant system. This work highlights the utility of using the HLD concept in designing microemulsion-based washing formulations from surfactants for the removal of vegetable oil from SBE.', 'Cold Water Detergency of Triacylglycerol Semisolid Soils: The Effect of Salinity, Alcohol Type, and Surfactant Systems  2018 AOCSCold water detergency of triacylglycerol semisolid soils is much more challenging than liquid vegetable oils due to poorer interaction between surfactants and semisolid soil. This research seeks to improve the removal efficiency of semisolid soils below their melting points using surfactant-based formulations containing different alcohol additives. To this end, cold water detergency of solid coconut oil and solid palm kernel oil was investigated in various surfactant/alcohol systems, including single anionic extended surfactants, single nonionic alcohol ethoxylate surfactants, and a mixture of anionic surfactants. A series of alcohols (2-butanol, 1-hexanol, 1-heptanol, 1-octanol, 1-nonanol, and 1-decanol) were added to the surfactant formulations to investigate cold water detergency improvement. While cold water detergency using surfactants alone was poor, it was considerably improved when optimum salinity (S*) and 1-heptanol, 1-octanol, or 1-nonanol were introduced to the studied surfactant formulations. The maximum detergency of solid coconut oil exceeded 90% removal in the 0.1 w/v% C14-15-8PO-SO4Na/0.2 w/v% 1-octanol/4 w/v% NaCl system (a final optimized surfactant system) at a washing temperature of 10°C versus 22.9 ± 2.2% in the surfactant alone (not at optimum salinity and no additive). Further analysis showed that improved cold water detergency using surfactant/intermediate-chain alcohols/NaCl could be correlated with high wettability (low contact angle) as well as favorable surfactant system-soil interaction as observed by lower interfacial tension values. In contrast, the improved cold water detergency was observed to be independent of dispersion stability. This work thus demonstrates that surfactant system design, including additives, can improve cold water detergency of semisolid soils and should be further explored in future research.']"

Our study, using data from the largest biopsy-proven NAFLD international registry within Asia, aims to characterize the demographic, metabolic and histological differences between non-obese and obese NAFLD patients. Methods: 1812 biopsy-proven NAFLD patients across nine countries in Asia assessed between 2006 and 2019 were pooled into a curated clinical registry. Demographic, metabolic and histological differences between non-obese and obese NAFLD patients were evaluated.

The fibrosis stage was scored using nonalcoholic steatohepatitis CRN criteria, and significant fibrosis was defined as at least fibrosis stage 2. RESULTS A total of 511 patients with biopsy-proven NAFLD and complete data were included for validation. Of these 511 patients, 271 (53.0%) were female, with a median age of 51 (interquartile range: 41, 58) years. The median BMI was 29 (26.3, 32.6) kg/m2, and 268 (52.4%) had diabetes. Among the 511 NAFLD patients, 157 (30.7%) had significant fibrosis (≥ F2). The areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves of the FIB-8 and FIB-4 scores and NFS for predicting significant fibrosis were 0.774, 0.743, and 0.680, respectively. The FIB-8 score demonstrated significantly better performance for predicting significant fibrosis than the NFS (P = 0.001) and was also clinically superior to FIB-4, although statistical significance was not reached (P = 0.073). The low cutoff point of the FIB-8 score for predicting significant fibrosis of 0.88 showed 92.36% sensitivity, and the high cutoff point of the FIB-8 score for predicting significant fibrosis of 1.77 showed 67.51% specificity. CONCLUSION We demonstrated that the FIB-8 score had significantly better performance for predicting significant fibrosis in NAFLD patients than the NFS, as well as clinically superior performance vs the FIB-4 score in an Asian population. A novel simple fibrosis score comprising commonly accessible basic laboratories may be beneficial to use for an initial assessment in primary care units, excluding patients with significant liver fibrosis and aiding in patient selection for further hepatologist referral.', 'Screening for non-alcoholic fatty liver disease in community setting: A cohort study using controlled attenuation parameter-transient elastography  2019 The Authors. JGH Open: An open access journal of gastroenterology and hepatology published by Journal of Gastroenterology and Hepatology Foundation and John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd.Background/Aim: The global problems of chronic liver disease and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) are increasing. We examined the prevalence of NAFLD and significant liver stiffness in an asymptomatic population and identified the predictors of significant fibrosis in NAFLD. Method: We prospectively enrolled Thai subjects, aged 18–80 years, from four regions (Bangkok, Central, North, South) of Thailand from March 2013 to November 2016. All participants underwent controlled attenuation parameter (CAP) measurement for liver fat quantification and transient elastography (TE) for liver stiffness measurement (LSM). NAFLD was defined as liver fat ≥10% (CAP ≥ 306 dB/m). Of 1145 participants, 782 (68.3%) were eligible for analysis. Result: The mean age ± standard deviation (SD) was 53.1 ± 4.6 years, and 71.6% were female. The mean ± SD values of CAP and LSM of the overall cohort were 241.9 ± 61.4 dB/m and 5.5 ± 3.8 kPa, respectively. The prevalence of NAFLD was 18.0%, whereas 5.4% of the cohort had nonobese NAFLD (BMI < 25 kg/m2), and 2.8% had lean NAFLD (BMI < 23 kg/m2). The prevalence of significant liver fibrosis (≥F2) in NAFLD subjects was 18.4%. On multivariate analysis, the degree of significant fibrosis in NAFLD was significantly associated with male gender and a history of dyslipidemia. Conclusion: NAFLD with significant fibrosis (≥F2) is prevalent in asymptomatic populations. The predictors of significant fibrosis in NAFLD were male gender and dyslipidemia. Screening for NAFLD using CAP/TE in asymptomatic populations should be considered in hospitals with available facilities.']"

Methods: Prospective data from baseline and 4-month follow-up including Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), Numerical Rating Scale (NRS), 14-item Oral Health Impact Profile (OHIP-14) and 15-item and 26-item Chronic Oral Mucosal Disease Questionnaire (COMDQ-15; COMDQ-26) were collected from 281 patients with OLP. An anchoring approach based upon the patient’s opinion on acceptability of OLP status was applied. Associated factors for achieving the PASS were analysed using multivariate logistic regression. Results: About two-thirds (68.7%) of participants rated their OLP status as acceptable. Cut-off thresholds for PASS were as follows: ≤ 28 mm for VAS, ≤ 3 for NRS, ≤ 18 for total OHIP-14, ≤ 26 for total COMDQ-15 and ≤ 48 for total COMDQ-26. Based upon results of multivariate logistic analysis, factors associated with being in PASS were lower pain intensity, lower depressive symptoms and lower disease activity of OLP.

Sixty-nine patients were interviewed using the Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) for pain perception and Oral Impacts on Daily Performance (OIDP) index. OLP signs examined included localization, types, number of affected sides and clinical severity using the Thongprasom sign scoring system. There were significant associations (rs = 0.490, p < 0.001) between clinical severity and the intensity of oral impacts as well as pain (rs = 0.298, p = 0.013). The intensity of oral impacts and pain increased according to the increasing OLP clinical severity, except for the white striae lesions (Thongprasom sign score 1). The erosive/ulcerative OLP lesions (Thongprasom sign scores 4 and 5) were the most painful symptom and had the highest degree of oral impacts (p < 0.001).

The 15-item Chronic Oral Mucosal Disease Questionnaire (COMDQ-15) and 14-item Oral Health Impact Profile (OHIP-14) were used to assess the level of QoL related to OLP. A number of potential determinants were considered, including patient demographics, treatment, the severity of oral symptoms, the clinical activity of the disease, and the patient psychological status, which were measured using the pain-Numerical Rating Scale, the Oral Disease Severity Score, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, and the 10-item Perceived Stress Scale. Multivariate linear regression was employed to identify independent determinants associated with overall and aspects of QoL. Results: On multivariate analyses, after adjusting for confounding variables, the QoL levels in patients with OLP were significantly associated with levels of oral pain, anxiety, stress and use of topical corticosteroids. The COMDQ-15 instrument performed better than OHIP-14 at capturing the association between QoL and pain and disease activity in patients with OLP. Conclusion: Clinicians should expect reduced QoL in OLP patients with high pain levels, high anxiety levels, high perceived stress and use of topical corticosteroids. The COMDQ-15 is best suited to measure QoL in this population.']"

In this context additional beam collimation and range reduction was implemented. Methods and materials: The clinical proton beam line employing pencil beam scanning (PBS) was adapted for the irradiation of small fields at shallow depths. Cylindrical collimators with apertures of 15, 12, 7 and 5 mm as well as two different range shifter types, placed at different distances relative to the target, were tested: a bolus range shifter (BRS) attached to the collimator and a clinical nozzle mounted range shifter (CRS) placed at a distance of 72 cm from the collimator. The Monte Carlo (MC) based dose calculation engine implemented in the clinical treatment planning system (TPS) was commissioned for these two additional hardware components. The study was conducted with a phantom and cylindrical target sizes between 2 and 25 mm in diameter following a dosimetric end-to-end test concept. Results: The setup with the CRS provided a uniform dose distribution across the target. An agreement of better than 5% between the planned dose and the measurements was obtained for a target with 3 mm diameter (collimator 5 mm). A 2 mm difference between the collimator and the target diameter (target being 2 mm smaller than the collimator) sufficed to cover the whole target with the planned dose in the setup with CRS. Using the BRS setup (target 8 mm, collimator 12 mm) resulted in non-homogeneous dose distributions, with a dose discrepancy of up to 10% between the planned and measured doses. Conclusion: The clinical proton infrastructure with adequate beam line adaptations and a state-of-the-art TPS based on MC dose calculations enables small animal irradiations with a high dosimetric precision and accuracy for target sizes down to 3 mm.', 'Dosimetric evaluation of photons versus protons in postmastectomy planning for ultrahypofractionated breast radiotherapy  2022, The Author(s).Background: Ultrahypofractionation can shorten the irradiation period. This study is the first dosimetric investigation comparing ultrahypofractionation using volumetric arc radiation therapy (VMAT) and intensity-modulated proton radiation therapy (IMPT) techniques in postmastectomy treatment planning. Materials and methods: Twenty postmastectomy patients (10-left and 10-right sided) were replanned with both VMAT and IMPT techniques. There were four scenarios: left chest wall, left chest wall including regional nodes, right chest wall, and right chest wall including regional nodes. The prescribed dose was 26 Gy(RBE) in 5 fractions. For VMAT, a 1-cm bolus was added for 2 in 5 fractions. For IMPT, robust optimization was performed on the CTV structure with a 3-mm setup uncertainty and a 3.5% range uncertainty. This study aimed to compare the dosimetric parameters of the PTV, ipsilateral lung, contralateral lung, heart, skin, esophageal, and thyroid doses. Results: The PTV-D95 was kept above 24.7 Gy(RBE) in both VMAT and IMPT plans. The ipsilateral lung mean dose of the IMPT plans was comparable to that of the VMAT plans. In three of four scenarios, the V5 of the ipsilateral lung in IMPT plans was lower than in VMAT plans. The Dmean and V5 of heart dose were reduced by a factor of 4 in the IMPT plans of the left side. For the right side, the Dmean of the heart was less than 1 Gy(RBE) for IMPT, while the VMAT delivered approximately 3 Gy(RBE). The IMPT plans showed a significantly higher skin dose owing to the lack of a skin-sparing effect in the proton beam. The IMPT plans provided lower esophageal and thyroid mean dose. Conclusion: Despite the higher skin dose with the proton plan, IMPT significantly reduced the dose to adjacent organs at risk, which might translate into the reduction of late toxicities when compared with the photon plan.', 'The impact of corrected field output factors based on IAEA/AAPM code of practice on small-field dosimetry to the calculated monitor unit in eclipse™ treatment planning system  2020 The Authors. Journal of Applied Clinical Medical Physics published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc. on behalf of American Association of Physicists in MedicineThe objective of this study was to investigate the effect of field output factors (FOFs) according to the current protocol for small-field dosimetry in conjunction to treatment planning system (TPS) commissioning. The calculated monitor unit (MU) for intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) and volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) plans in Eclipse™ TPS were observed. Micro ion chamber (0.01 CC) (CC01), photon field diode (shielded diode) (PFD), and electron field diode (unshielded diode) (EFD) were used to measure percentage depth doses, beam profiles, and FOFs from 1 × 1 cm2 to 10 × 10 cm2 field sizes of 6 MV photon beams. CC01 illustrated the highest percentage depth doses at 10 cm depth while EFD exhibited the lowest with the difference of 1.6% at 1 × 1 cm2. CC01 also produced slightly broader penumbra, the difference with other detectors was within 1 mm. For uncorrected FOF of three detectors, the maximum percent standard deviation (%SD) was 5.4% at 1 × 1 cm2 field size. When the correction factors were applied, this value dropped to 2.7%. For the calculated MU in symmetric field sizes, beam commissioning group from uncorrected FOF demonstrated maximum %SD of 6.0% at 1 × 1 cm2 field size. This value decreased to 2.2% when the corrected FOF was integrated. For the calculated MU in IMRT-SRS plans, the impact of corrected FOF reduced the maximum %SD from 6.0% to 2.5% in planning target volume (PTV) less than 0.5 cm3. Beam commissioning using corrected FOF also decreased %SD for VMAT-SRS plans, although it was less pronounced in comparison to other treatment planning techniques, since the %SD remained less than 2%. The use of FOFs based on IAEA/AAPM TRS 483 has been proven in this research to reduce the discrepancy of calculated MU among three beam commissioning datasets in Eclipse™ TPS. The dose measurement of both symmetric field and clinical cases comparing to the calculation illustrated the dependence of the types of detector commissioning and the algorithm of the treatment planning for small field size.']"

Of 53 excised lesions, 6 (11%) were upgraded to invasive cancer or ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). 4 of 21 (19%) ADH lesions were upgraded to DCIS. 2 of 36 (6%) lobular neoplasia lesions, both combined ALH and LCIS, were upgraded to DCIS, and invasive lobular carcinoma, respectively. The remaining 46 lesions were managed conservatively with imaging follow-up: 17 (37%) had mammography only, while 29 (63%) had mammography and MRI follow-up. There was no evidence of breast cancer development at the site of MRI-VAB in the cases with only imaging follow-up. conclusion: We conclude that the upgrade rate for high-risk lesions at MRI-VAB at surgical excision is low.

Materials and Methods: The authors retrospectively enrolled 190 post-BCT female patients who underwent post-operative surveillance by breast MRI and mammography with ultrasonography at King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital between January 1, 2008 and July 1, 2019. Two radiologists reviewed the images from the two surveillance modalities, independently. The information including radiological and histopathological data were blinded during the review process. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) were then estimated to reflect the diagnostic performance of the two modalities for detection of local recurrent breast cancer. Results: Of the 190 patients, 52 (27.4%) were diagnosed as local recurrent breast cancer. Sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV were 98.1%, 92%, 82.3%, 99.2%, respectively, for breast MRI, and 88.5%, 62.3%, 46.9%, 93.5%, respectively, for mammography with ultrasonography. The findings that could be better evaluated by breast MRI than by mammography with ultrasonography included post-operative change and benign mass (p<0.001), suspicious mass (p<0.001), and suspicious calcification (p<0.003). Conclusion: Breast MRI is superior to mammography with ultrasonography for detection of local recurrent breast cancer after BCT. Furthermore, MRI can help clinicians avoid unnecessary biopsy and surgical interventions due to its ability to differentiate post-treatment change from local recurrent breast cancer.', 'Performance of breast magnetic resonance imaging in axillary nodal staging in newly diagnosed breast cancer patients  Pol J Radiol 2019.Purpose: To determine the diagnostic value of breast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in detecting axillary metastatic node in newly diagnosed breast cancer, we assessed the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) of breast MRI. Material and methods: Data were collected retrospectively from January 2011 to December 2018. Preoperative breast MRI of women with newly diagnosed breast cancer were reviewed to evaluate the axillary nodal staging by using the morphological characteristic of metastatic axillary lymph node. Statistical analysis was performed to assess the performance of breast MRI in diagnosing metastatic axillary lymph nodes based on the pathological result. Results: A total of 131 women with breast cancer were analysed. Two hundred and twenty-seven axillary lymph nodes from preoperative breast MRIs were considered to be metastasis. 65.65% (86 patients) of the breast MRI results matched with the pathological results: 37 patients with N0 stage, 39 patients with N1 stage, eight patients with N2 stage, and two patients with N3 stage.

The aim of this randomized clinical trial was to investigate the impact of acemannan in guided bone regeneration (GBR) with simultaneous implant placement. Twenty patients were randomly allocated to a test group (deproteinized bovine bone with particulate acemannan (mean size 32.45 μm)) and a control group (deproteinized bovine bone only). Twenty implants were placed with simultaneous GBR. Radiographic measurements were conducted on cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) scans immediately post-surgery and at 3 and 6 months.

However, the effect of acemannan sponges on bone formation in open-type sinus augmentation has not evaluated. Here, we report a case study using radiographic and histological analyses to investigate the effect of acemannan on bone formation after lateral sinus lift surgery. The case was a 57-year-old female patient with an atrophic left posterior maxilla who underwent lateral sinus lift using an acemannan sponge using the two-stage procedure.

Cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) images were taken immediately as baseline and 6-month postoperation for evaluation. A bone core specimen was also obtained for histological examination at the time of implant placement. The histological results revealed new bone formation, and the CBCT images demonstrated increased alveolar bone height at 6-month postoperation.

We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to synthesize the available strategies to reduce FGF23 in CKD patients. Methods: We conducted a meta-analysis by searching the databases of MEDLINE, Scopus, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and single-arm studies that examined the effects of dietary phosphate restriction, phosphate binders, iron supplements, calcimimetics, parathyroidectomy, dialysis techniques, and the outcome of preservation of residual renal function (RRF) on FGF23 levels in CKD patients. Random-effects model meta-analyses were used to compute changes in the outcome of interests. Results: A total of 41 articles (7590 patients), comprising 36 RCTs, 5 prospective studies were included in this meta-analysis. Dietary phosphate restriction less than 800 mg per day yielded insignificant effect on FGF23 reduction. Interestingly sevelamer, lanthanum, iron-based phosphate binders, and iron supplement significantly lowered FGF23 levels. In CKD patients with secondary hyperparathyroidism, calcimimetics prescription could significantly reduce FGF23 levels, while surgical parathyroidectomy had no significant effect. In dialysis patients, preservation of RRF and hemoperfusion as well as hemodiafiltration provided a significant decrease in FGF23 levels.

Results: In phase 1, the baseline serum iPTH levels were not different [1374 (955, 1639) pg/mL in the control group vs. 1191 (1005, 1884) pg/mL in the cinacalcet group], the percentage of patients achieving iPTH target were significantly higher in the treatment group [80% vs. 13%, p =.001]. In phase 2, the significant reductions of iPTH, FGF-23, tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase 5b, and slightly decreased size of parathyroid gland and stabilized vascular calcification were observed at 24-week follow up and markedly rebounded after discontinuation of cinacalcet. Conclusions: The effectiveness of cinacalcet were still obviously demonstrated even in chronic HD patients with severe SHPT. In addition, the improvements of bone markers and FGF-23, and stabilization of vascular calcification were observed. Therefore, cinacalcet can provide salutary effects on CKD-MBD in severe SHPT and might be an initially effective PTH-lowering therapy prior to surgical parathyroidectomy as well as an alternative treatment in the patients unsuitable for surgery. Clinical trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT02056730. Date of registration: February 4, 2014.', 'Cinacalcet for treatment of chronic kidney disease-mineral and bone disorder: A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials  2018 S. Karger AG, Basel.Background: Cinacalcet could decrease serum calcium, phosphate, and parathyroid hormone (PTH) in previous meta-analyses. However, the effect of cinacalcet on the new biomarkers such as fibroblast growth factor-23 (FGF-23), bone markers, and vascular calcification are still unestablished. We conducted a meta-analysis to examine the effects of cinacalcet on all laboratory and clinical spectrums of chronic kidney disease-mineral bone disorders (CKD-MBD). Methods: A systematic literature search was conducted in MEDLINE, Scopus, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and Clinical Trials.gov to identify randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing the effect of cinacalcet relative to standard treatment on CKD-MBD surrogate markers and clinical outcomes. Random-effect models were used to compute the weighted mean difference for continuous variables and the risk ratio for binary variables. Results: Twenty-four RCTs (10,031 dialysis patients) were identified. Besides lowering effects on calcium, phosphate, and PTH, cinacalcet significantly reduced bone resorptive marker (tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase 5b) but unaltered bone formation markers (bone alkaline phosphatase and osteocalcin). Cinacalcet also resulted in significant higher risk of hypocalcemia, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Cinacalcet significantly lowered serum FGF-23 level, although unaltered all-cause mortalities. Conclusions: Use of cinacalcet in dialysis patients improves several CKD-MBD-related surrogate markers. However, the benefit on all-cause mortalities was not demonstrated.']"

PNMAis of interest owing to its higher solubility in organic solvents when compared to the unsubstituted polyaniline. However, the electrical conductivity of polyaniline derivatives suffers from chemical substitution. PNMAwas synthesized via emulsion polymerization using three different anionic surfactants, namely sodium dodecylsulfate (SDS), sodium dodecylbenzenesulfonate (SDBS), and dioctyl sodium sulfosuccinate (AOT). The effects of surfactant structures and concentrations on electrical conductivity, doping level, crystallinity, morphology, and thermal stability were investigated. The re-doping step using perchloric acid (HClO4) as a dopant was sequentially proceeded to enhance electrical conductivity. PNMA synthesized in SDBS at five times its critical micelle concentration (CMC) demonstrated the highest electrical conductivity, doping level, and thermal stability among all surfactants at identical concentrations. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images revealed that the PNMAparticle shapes and sizes critically depended on the surfactant types and concentrations, and the doping mole ratios in the re-doping step. The highest electrical conductivity of 109.84 20.44 S cm-1 and a doping level of 52.45% were attained at the doping mole ratio of 50:1.', 'In-situ polymerization of polyaniline in PDADMAC/PSS complex membranes: Effect of the polyelectrolyte stoichiometry  2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.The direct polymerization of a polymer in a polyelectrolyte complex membrane is a quick and simple method to enhance the properties and add functionality to a pre-formed membrane. Here, polyelectrolyte complex membrane (PECs) of poly (diallyl dimethyl ammonium chloride) (PDADMAC) [P+] and poly (styrene sulfonate) [P−] were modified by the in-situ polymerization of aniline monomer into polyaniline (PANI). The initial PECs were prepared by the co-precipitation of polyelectrolytes with various [P+]: [P−] molar ratio and were formed into 100 micron thin membranes by compression molding. The in-situ polymerization of PANI was achieved by sequential dipping of the PECs in ammonium peroxydisulfate solution to load the oxidant and in the aniline monomer solution to initiate the polymerization. Both the polyelectrolyte stoichiometry and the NaCl concentration used during the formation of the complex were found to have a profound effect on the polymerization reaction. UV–visible spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, and infrared spectroscopy were used to characterize the changes in color of the PANI membranes and to confirm the synthesis of PANI. Scanning electron microscopy revealed the presence of a dense coating of PANI at the surface of the PEC.', 'Synthesis of Janus polyaniline–polyelectrolyte complex membrane via in situ confined polymerization  2021 Society of Industrial Chemistry.Polyelectrolyte complex (PEC) membranes prepared from poly(styrene sulfonate) (PSS) and poly(diallyldimethylammonium chloride) (PDADMAC) were modified by crossflow polymerization of aniline (ANI). The PEC membranes were used as separators in a two-compartment setup where ANI monomer and ammonium persulfate (APS) oxidant diffused through the membranes to form polyaniline (PANI). APS and ANI having different distributions throughout the membranes, the reaction led to the asymmetric polymerization of PANI on one face of each PEC membrane thus producing Janus membranes. Due to the excess PANI content, the membrane displayed distinct asymmetric electrical conductivities on each face. Interestingly, very different ANI polymerizations were obtained when nonstoichiometric PEC membranes having different molar ratio of cationic and anionic polyelectrolytes (P+:P− represents PDADMAC:PSS) were used and transport of APS was fastest through the 2:1 PEC when compared to the 1:2 PEC. In all experiments, the polymerization was most intense on the ANI side of the membranes. Also, the influence of NaCl both during PEC fabrication and during polymerization was studied and found to have some effect on the solute permeability. Results showed that a higher content of PANI was formed on PEC membranes having excess P+ and with no NaCl added during PEC fabrication. Although X-ray diffraction confirmed the presence of PANI on both sides of each membrane, scanning electron microscopy images demonstrated that both sides of each membrane had different PANI content deposited. Electrical conductivity measurements using a four-point probe setup also showed that the PEC–PANI exhibits asymmetric electrical property on different sides.  2021 Society of Industrial Chemistry.']"

All rights reserved.Objectives: This study compared the carotid intima-media thickness (cIMT) among well suppressed adult participants living with HIV and adults without HIV, aged >45 years. Methods: Across-sectional, age and sex-matched study was conducted at two sites in Thailand: King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital (KCMH) and HIV-NAT. All participants had no evidence of coronary artery disease (CAD). Ultrasonography of the carotid artery was measured by one well-trained neurologist who was blinded to the participants' care. The primary endpoint was the difference in cIMT between participants with HIV and controls without HIV. Prevalence and predictive risk of cIMT≥0.9 mm were determined. Results: Of 90 individuals, 60 were living with HIV. The overall median (IQR) age was 54.1 (52-60) years and 53.3% were male.

Cardiovascular risk factors, including the predictor of subclinical atherosclerosis, carotid intima-media thickness (cIMT), are reported to be associated with NCI. Data on NCI and its association with cIMT among HIV positive are limited, especially in Asian populations. We aimed to determine the prevalence of NCI and its association with cIMT among HIV-positive and HIV-negative aging Thai individuals. Cognitive performance was evaluated by the Thai version of Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) with a cutoff of <25/30 for diagnosis of NCI. Depression was evaluated by PHQ-9 Patient Depression Questionnaire, with scores ≥5 indicating depression. cIMT measurement was performed by experienced neurologists, and abnormal cIMT was defined as cIMT ≥0.9 mm or presence of carotid plaques. Among 340 well suppressed and aging HIV-positive and 102 HIV-negative matched participants, the median age (interquartile range) was 55 (52-59) years and 61.5% were males. For HIV positive group, the median duration on antiretroviral therapy was 18.3 years with median CD4 of 615.5 cells/mm3, and 97.4% had current plasma HIV RNA <50 copies/mL.

Little is known regarding the nutritional status among elderly people living with HIV (PLHIV). We aimed to study the prevalence of malnutrition and the associated factors in a Thai aging cohort. A cross-sectional study was conducted among PLHIV >50 years of age on long-term antiretroviral therapy and HIV-negative controls, frequency matched by sex and age in Bangkok, Thailand. Nutritional status was assessed by the Mini Nutrition Assessment (MNA) tool. Abnormal nutritional status was defined as MNA score <24 (malnutrition and at risk of malnutrition). Body composition was measured by bioelectrical impedance analysis using Body Composition Analyzer. Demographic and disease-related factors were assessed for their association with abnormal nutrition status using multivariable logistic regression. There were 349 PLHIV and 103 HIV-uninfected controls, with median age 55 years. The majority were male (63%) with median body mass index (BMI) of 23.4 kg/m2. PLHIV had lower BMI [median, 23.1 (IQR, 20.8-25.2) vs. 25.3 (22.3-28.7) kg/m2, p < .001], lower fat percent [22.8% vs. 26.3%, p < .001] and lower fat mass [14.2 vs. 16.9 kg, p < .001] and higher abnormal nutritional status (18.05% vs. 6.8%, p = .005) than controls.

All rights reserved.Background and Aims: There remains a historical misconception that inflammatory bowel disease [IBD] patients are underweight. However, recent data suggest rates of obesity in IBD parallel to those of the general population. The impact obesity has on the natural history of IBD is unclear. We aimed to determine obesity rates at the time of IBD diagnosis in a population-based cohort of ulcerative colitis [UC] patients. Methods: Chart review was performed on patients diagnosed with UC over 1970-2010. Data were collected on demographics, body mass index [BMI], disease characteristics, IBD-specific hospitalisations, intestinal resection, and corticosteroid use. The proportion of patients who were obese at the time of their diagnosis was evaluated over time, and survival free of IBD-related complications was assessed using Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. Results: A total of 417 adults were diagnosed with UC over 1970-2010, 55.4% of whom were classified as either overweight [34.8%] or obese [20.6%]. The prevalence of obesity increased 2-3-fold over the 40-year study period. Obese patients had a 72% increased risk of hospitalisation (hazard ratio [HR],1.72; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.10-2.71; p = 0.018) when compared with normal weight patients. Additionally, with each incremental increase in BMI by 1 kg/m2, the risk of hospitalisation increased by 5% [HR,1.05; 95% CI, 1.01-1.08; p = 0.008] and risk of corticosteroid use increased by 2.6% [HR,1.026; 95% CI, 1.00-1.05; p = 0.05].

We conducted a population-based study to assess the relationship between urbanization and incidence of IBD in the Asia-Pacific region.METHODS:Newly diagnosed IBD cases between 2011 and 2013 from 13 countries or regions in Asia-Pacific were included. Incidence was calculated with 95% confidence interval (CI) and pooled using random-effects model. Meta-regression analysis was used to assess incidence rates and their association with population density, latitude, and longitude.RESULTS:We identified 1175 ulcerative colitis (UC), 656 Crohn's disease (CD), and 37 IBD undetermined (IBD-U). Mean annual IBD incidence per 100 000 was 1.50 (95% CI: 1.43-1.57). India (9.31; 95% CI: 8.38-10.31) and China (3.64; 95% CI, 2.97-4.42) had the highest IBD incidence in Asia. Incidence of overall IBD (incidence rate ratio [IRR]: 2.19; 95% CI: 1.01-4.76]) and CD (IRR: 3.28; 95% CI: 1.83-9.12) was higher across 19 areas of Asia with a higher population density. In China, incidence of IBD (IRR: 2.37; 95% CI: 1.10-5.16) and UC (IRR: 2.63; 95% CI: 1.2-5.8) was positively associated with gross domestic product.

Methods: We conducted a population-based case-control study using the Rochester Epidemiology Project of Olmsted County, Minnesota. We identified 736 county residents diagnosed with IBD between 1980 and 2010 who were matched to 1472 controls, based on age, sex and date of IBD diagnosis. Data on antibiotic use between 3 months and 5 years before IBD diagnosis were collected. Logistic regression models were used to estimate associations between antibiotic use and IBD, and were expressed as adjusted odds ratio [AOR] with 95% confidence interval [CI]. Results: Antibiotic use occurred in 455 IBD cases [61.8%] and 495 controls [33.6%] [p < 0.001].

Birth weights of the piglets were measured immediately at birth and again at 24 h thereafter to determine the individual colostrum intake of the piglets. On average, the farrowing duration, birth interval and BA were 188.0 ± 95.7 min, 12.5 ± 18.3 min, and 12.3 ± 2.9 piglets per litter, respectively. The farrowing duration of the sows was reduced in CARBE group (151.2 ± 11.9 min) compared to OXY (180.2 ± 11.5 min, P = 0.003) and CONTROL (227.7 ± 11.2 min, P < 0.001) groups. Birth interval of piglets in all categories of birth weight in the CARBE group was shorter than those in the CONTROL group (P < 0.05). However, the colostrum yield of sows in CARBE group (2398 ± 133 g) was lower than CONTROL and OXY groups (3371 ± 125 g and 3549 ± 128 g, respectively; P < 0.001). Similarly, colostrum intake of piglets in the CONTROL and OXY groups was higher than in the CARBE group (276.4 ± 11.0 g, 286.4 ± 13.6 g and 225.3 ± 14.0 g, respectively; P < 0.05). The percentage of stillborn piglets in CARBE was higher than OXY (8.7 ± 1.1% vs 5.3 ± 1.1%, P < 0.05) but did not differ significantly compared to CONTROL (7.5 ± 1.1%, P > 0.05). The piglet movement capacity in CONTROL was lower than CARBE group (1.36 vs 1.48, P < 0.05) but was not different compared to OXY group (1.40, P > 0.05). In conclusion, administration of carbetocin after the birth of the first piglet reduced the farrowing duration of sows, but increased the number of stillborn piglets and reduced the colostrum yield of sows.', 'Pen Versus Crate: A Comparative Study on the Effects of Different Farrowing Systems on Farrowing Performance, Colostrum Yield and Piglet Preweaning Mortality in Sows under Tropical Conditions  2023 by the authors.The present study was performed to determine the farrowing performance of sows, newborn piglet characteristics, colostrum yield, milk yield and piglet preweaning mortality in a free-farrowing pen compared to a conventional farrowing crate system in a tropical environment. A total of 92 sows and 1344 piglets were included in the study. The sows were allocated by parity into two farrowing systems, either a free-farrowing pen (n = 54 sows and 805 piglets) or a crate (n = 38 sows and 539 piglets). Backfat thickness and loin muscle depth of sows at 109.0 ± 3.0 days of gestation were measured. Reproductive performance data including total number of piglets born (TB), number of piglets born alive (BA), percentage of stillborn piglets (SB) and percentage of mummified foetuses (MF) per litter, farrowing duration, piglet expulsion interval, time from onset of farrowing to the last placental expulsion, piglet preweaning mortality rate, percentage of piglets crushed by sows and number of piglets at weaning were analysed. In addition, piglet colostrum intake, colostrum yield, Brix index and milk yield of sows were evaluated. On average, TB, BA, farrowing duration, colostrum yield and milk yield during 3 to 10 and 10 to 17 days of lactation were 14.7 ± 2.8, 12.8 ± 3.1, 213.2 ± 142.2 min, 5.3 ± 1.4 kg, 8.6 ± 1.5 kg, and 10.4 ± 2.2 kg, respectively. Sows kept in the free-farrowing pen tended to produce more colostrum than crated sows (5.5 ± 0.2 vs. 4.9 ± 0.2 kg, p = 0.080). Piglets born in the free-farrowing pen had a higher colostrum intake than those in the crate system (437.0 ± 6.9 and 411.7 ± 8.3 g, p = 0.019). However, the piglet preweaning mortality rate (26.8 ± 2.9 vs. 17.0 ± 3.8, p = 0.045) and the proportion of piglets crushed by sows (13.1 ± 2.1 vs. 5.8 ± 2.7, p = 0.037) in the free-farrowing pen were higher than those in the crate system. Interestingly, in the free-farrowing pen, piglet preweaning mortality rate in sows with high backfat thickness was higher than that in sows with moderate (37.8 ± 5.1% vs. 21.6 ± 3.6%, p = 0.011) and low (21.0 ± 6.2%, p = 0.038) backfat thickness. Moreover, the incidence of crushing in sows with high backfat thickness was higher in the free-farrowing pen than in the crate system (17.6 ± 3.6 vs. 4.0 ± 5.7, p = 0.049), but this difference was not detected for sows with moderate and low backfat thickness (p > 0.05). Milk yield of sows during 3 to 10 days (8.6 ± 0.2 vs. 8.6 ± 2.3, p > 0.05) and 10 to 17 days (10.2 ± 0.3 vs. 10.4 ± 0.4, p > 0.05) did not differ between the two farrowing systems. In conclusion, piglets born in the free-farrowing pen had a higher colostrum intake than those in the crate system. However, the piglet preweaning mortality rate and the proportion of piglets crushed by sows in the free-farrowing pen were higher than in the crate system. Interestingly, a high proportion of piglet preweaning mortality in the free-farrowing system was detected only in sows with high backfat thickness before farrowing but not in those with low and moderate backfat thickness. Therefore, additional management in sows with high backfat thickness (>24 mm) before farrowing should be considered to avoid the crushing of piglets by sows.', 'Effect of carbetocin administration during the mid-period of parturition on farrowing duration, newborn piglet characteristics, colostrum yield and milk yield in hyperprolific sows  2021 Elsevier Inc.Control of the farrowing process is crucial to reduce the risk of post-parturient disorders in sows and newborn piglet mortality. Carbetocin is a long-acting oxytocin-like compound that has been introduced to domestic animal obstetrics. The aims of the present study were to evaluate the effects of carbetocin administration during the mid-period of parturition on farrowing duration as well as colostrum and milk production and its side effects on neonatal piglet characteristics in hyperprolific sows. The study included 89 Landrace x Yorkshire crossbred sows and 1534 piglets. Sows were randomly distributed into two groups: CONTROL (n = 46), where sows were allowed to farrow naturally, and TREATMENT (n = 43), where sows were administered 0.5 μg/kg carbetocin intramuscularly after the birth of the 7th piglet. In each litter, the piglets were classified into two groups according to birth order: 1–7 and ≥8. The colostrum yield of sows and the colostrum intake of each individual piglet were calculated. Litter weight gain of the piglets from 3 to 5 days of lactation was used to estimate milk yield. Farrowing duration tended to be reduced from 338.4 ± 35.2 min in the CONTROL group to 255.3 ± 36.4 min in the TREATMENT group (P = 0.105). However, the colostrum yield in the TREATMENT group was lower than that in the CONTROL group (3828 ± 149 and 3041 ± 158 g, respectively, P < 0.001). Nevertheless, milk yield during 3–5 days of lactation in the TREATMENT group did not differ significantly compared to that in the CONTROL group (7.53 ± 0.01 and 7.54 ± 0.01 kg/day, respectively, P = 0.643). The incidence of stillbirths in the TREATMENT group was not significantly different from that in the CONTROL group (8.3 and 7.4%, respectively, P = 0.944). However, the incidence of piglets born with umbilical cord rupture in the TREATMENT group with birth order ≥8 was higher than that in the CONTROL group in the same birth order (16.6 and 5.7%, P < 0.001). Across groups, colostrum intake of piglets born with birth order ≥8 was lower than that of piglets born in the birth orders 1–7 (187.4 ± 8.7 and 241.5 ± 9.0 g, P < 0.001). Interestingly, the colostrum intake of piglets with birth orders 1–7 in the TREATMENT group was also lower than that of piglets with the same birth order in the CONTROL group (214.9 ± 12.9 and 268.1 ± 12.5 g, respectively, P = 0.003). Colostrum intake was lowest in the piglets with birth order ≥8 in the TREATMENT group (159.6 ± 12.3, P < 0.001). Carbetocin administration after the birth of the 7th piglet reduced the birth interval of piglets but increased the incidence of piglets born with umbilical rupture and reduced colostrum intake. Therefore, colostrum supplementation and care of the newborn piglets immediately after birth are strongly recommended after carbetocin administration.']"

Molecular characteristics of DOM removed by adsorbents were investigated semiquantitatively and unknown disinfection byproduct (DBP) formation potentials were also investigated. Adsorbents were modified using ferric nitrate to increase the magnetic property. The XRD pattern showed Fe-containing crystalline structures in the modified adsorbent (M-CF). The M-CF possessed higher mesopore volume, which enhanced the dissolved organic carbon (DOC) removal efficiency to 74.50% (compared to 32.12% in the unmodified CF adsorbent). The kinetics experiment showed that both adsorbents were better fitted to pseudo-second orders than pseudo-first orders. The initial rate constant was higher in M-CF (1.40 mg/g min) than in CF (0.02 mg/g min) treatments due to the higher mesopore volume in M-CF. M-CF removed almost 700 carbon‑hydrogen‑oxygen based DOMs (CHO features), 300 more CHO features than CF. CF selectively adsorbed only higher-molecular-weight (MW) CHO features (more CH2 groups), while the mesopores in M-CF removed DOM with lower MW (fewer CH2 groups) that were refractory to CF. The low MW DOM removed only by M-CF mesopore exhibited more oxidized (positive carbon oxidation state, Cos) and saturated characters (negative oxygen-subtracted double bond equivalent per carbon, (DBE-O)/C). After chlorination, over 50 unknown DBPs were detected, 33 of which were commonly found in all samples. M-CF decreased unknown formation potential more than CF. However, adsorption of M-CF and CF before chlorination resulted in different remaining precursors to water chlorination and formed unique DBPs from those precursors.', 'Synthesis of porous pig bone char as adsorbent for removal of DBP precursors from surface water  IWA Publishing 2019 Water Science & TechnologyThis research study aims to investigate the efficiency of synthesized porous pig bone char (PBC) for reduction of disinfection by-product (DBP) precursors from surface water. Dissolved organic matter (DOM) is commonly present in natural water and acts as a disinfection by-product precursor. Adsorption is one of the promising technologies that is commonly applied for DOM removal. Interestingly, the properties of pig bone are such that it has a surface area and pore volumes that can adsorb DOM. Pig bone was synthesized as porous bone char (PBC). The results show that synthesized PBC at 900 C (PBC-900 C) provides a high volume of mesoporous structure. The adsorption process was best fitted with the pseudo-second-order and Freundlich isotherm model. Thus, the mechanisms occurred on the multilayer adsorption of the surface. PBC-900 C can remove approximately 70-80% of DOM with varying concentrations, from 0.2 g/L to 0.8 g/L. Furthermore, the results of fluorescence excitation-emission (FEEM) showed that humic acids and humic-like substances in water can be removed by using PBC at concentrations higher than 0.4 g/L. From the obtained results, it can be concluded that PBC is an alternative low-cost adsorbent which can be utilized for reduction of DBP precursors from water.', 'Performance of dissolved organic matter removal from membrane bioreactor effluent by magnetic powdered activated carbon  2019 Elsevier LtdMagnetic powdered activated carbon (Mag-PAC) was successfully developed and applied as an adsorbent for dissolved organic matter (DOM) removal from the effluent of a membrane bioreactor (MBR) using batch experiments. The results show that a coating of iron oxide particles is consistently distributed on the surface of powdered activated carbon (PAC), resulting in a decrease in the specific surface area and in the pH at the point of zero charge, even though the particle sizes of Mag-PAC and PAC were similar. A Mag-PAC dosage of 4 g/L exhibited efficient and fast DOM adsorption with a relatively short contact time of 5 min. The iron oxide coating on the surface of PAC may play an important role in the DOM removal efficiency. Temkin isotherm and pseudo-second order kinetic models well described the DOM adsorption, suggesting that the adsorption of DOM onto Mag-PAC could be mainly governed by a chemisorption mechanism. Humic acid- and fulvic acid-like compounds and aromatic DOM with molecular weights (MWs) between 2610 Da and 3030 Da were efficiently removed by Mag-PAC, whereas aromatic DOM with an MW of 1760 Da was poorly removed. Our results demonstrate that the application of Mag-PAC for DOM adsorption is attractive and yields benefits as a posttreatment system for MBR effluent due to its efficient and fast DOM adsorption.']"

Autotaxin (ATX) is a secreted glycoprotein that is involved in the development of hepatic fibrogenesis via the enzymatic production of lysophosphatidic acid. The aim of this study was to investigate hepatic expression of ATX in biliary atresia (BA) compared with non-BA liver controls and to examine the association betweenATX expression and clinical outcome in BA. Methods. Liver specimens from BA infants (nD20) were compared with samples from infants who underwent liver biopsy for reasons other than BA (nD14) and served as controls. RelativemRNAand protein expression ofATXwere quantified using real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and immunohistochemistry. Masson's Trichrome staining was performed to determine the degree of liver fibrosis. Results. Quantitative real-time PCR demonstrated overexpression of ATX mRNA in BA livers. In immunohistochemical evaluation, ATX was positively stained on the hepatic parenchyma and the biliary epithelium in BA patients, as compared to non-BA controls. The immunostaining score of ATX in BA livers was also significantly higher than that observed in non-BA livers (P < 0:001). Subgroup analysis revealed that ATX expression in the patients with poor outcomes was significantly greater than in those with good outcomes (P D0:03). Additionally, there was a positive correlation between hepatic ATX expression and Metavir fibrosis stage in BA livers (r D0:79, P < 0:001). Discussion. This study found thatmRNAand protein expression ofATXwere increased in BA livers.

COMP protein levels in the circulation of 96 BA patients and 56 healthy controls and its mRNA and protein expressions in the liver of 20 BA patients and 5 non-BA patients were evaluated using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, real-time polymerase chain reaction, and immunohistochemistry, respectively. In the circulation of BA patients, COMP levels were significantly higher than those in healthy controls. Compared with early-stage BA patients, those with advanced-stage including jaundice, fibrosis, and hepatic dysfunction had significantly increased circulating COMP levels. Raised circulating COMP levels were found to be independently correlated with degree of liver fibrosis. Survival analysis showed that elevated circulating COMP levels were significantly associated with decreased survival of BA patients. Receiver-operating characteristic curve analysis unveiled a diagnostic value of circulating COMP as a non-invasive biomarker of BA (AUC = 0.99), with a sensitivity of 100.0% and a specificity of 98.2%. In the liver, both COMP mRNA and protein expressions of BA patients with fibrosis were significantly greater than those of BA patients without fibrosis and non-BA patients. Collectively, increased circulating COMP might reflect unfavorable outcome of BA patients and have potential as a novel biomarker for the disease severity following Kasai-operation.', 'Development of liver inflammatory injury in biliary atresia: from basic to clinical research  2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.Biliary atresia (BA) is a severe cholangiopathy in infants. It is characterized by inflammatory fibro-obliteration of the intra- and extrahepatic bile ducts. Although the restoration of bile flow can be successful after Kasai operation, the rapid progression of liver fibrosis can continue, leading to cirrhosis. It is believed that the progression of liver fibrosis in BA is exacerbated by complicated mechanisms other than the consequence of bile duct obstruction. The fibrogenic cascade in BA liver can be divided into three stages, including liver inflammatory injury, myofibroblast activation, and fibrous scar formation. Recent studies have revealed that the activation of an immune response following bile duct injury plays an important role in promoting the inflammatory process, the releasing of inflammatory cytokines, and the development of fibrogenesis in BA liver. In this article, we summarized the evidence regarding liver inflammatory injury and the possible mechanisms that explain the rapid progression of liver fibrosis in BA.']"

Despite the substantial efforts, only few vaccines are currently approved and some are in the different stages of clinical trials. As the disease rapidly spreads, an affordable and effective vaccine is urgently needed. In this study, we investigated the immunogenicity of plant-produced receptor-binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 in order to use as a subunit vaccine. In this regard, RBD of SARS-CoV-2 was fused with Fc fragment of human IgG1 and transiently expressed in Nicotiana benthamiana by agroinfiltration. The plant-produced RBD-Fc fusion protein was purified from the crude extract by using protein A affinity column chromatography. Two intramuscular administration of plant-produced RBD-Fc protein formulated with alum as an adjuvant have elicited high neutralization titers in immunized mice and cynomolgus monkeys. Further it has induced a mixed Th1/Th2 immune responses and vaccine-specific T-lymphocyte responses which was confirmed by interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) enzyme-linked immunospot assay. Altogether, our results demonstrated that the plant-produced SARS-CoV-2 RBD has the potential to be used as an effective vaccine candidate against SARS-CoV-2. To our knowledge, this is the first report demonstrating the immunogenicity of plant-produced SARS-CoV-2 RBD protein in mice and non-human primates.', 'Immunogenicity and efficacy of recombinant subunit SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidate in the Syrian hamster model  2022 The Author(s)SARS-CoV-2 causes devastating impact on the human population and has become a major public health concern.

The RBD-Fc fusion was produced in Nicotiana benthamiana. Previously, we reported that this plant-produced vaccine is effective in inducing immune response in both mice and non-human primates. Here, the efficacy of our vaccine candidate was tested in Syrian hamster challenge model.

Recently, diverse mutations in the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 were reported in United Kingdom (Alpha) and South Africa (Beta) strains which raise concerns over the potential increase in binding affinity towards the host cell receptor and diminished host neutralization capabilities. In order to study the effect of mutation in the binding efficiency of SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain (RBD) with anti-SARS-CoV/CoV-2 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), we have produced SARS-CoV-2 RBD and two variants SARS-CoV-2 RBD (Alpha RBD and Beta RBD) in Nicotiana benthamiana by transient expression. Plant-produced SARS-CoV-2 RBD-Fc, Alpha RBD-Fc and Beta RBD-Fc exhibited specific binding to human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor determined by ELISA. Intriguingly, the binding of plant-produced SARS-CoV-2 RBD proteins to plant-produced mAbs CR3022, B38, and H4 was found to be different depending on the variant mutation. In contrary to the plant-produced SARS-CoV-2 RBD-Fc and Alpha RBD-Fc, Beta RBD-Fc variant showed weak binding affinity towards the mAbs. The result suggested that the Beta RBD variant might have acquired partial resistance to neutralizing antibodies compared to other variants. However, further studies with sera from convalescent or vaccinated individuals are required to confirm this finding. Copyright:']"

The aim of this study was to determine whether pathologists could distinguish BRAF-like and RAS-like nuclear features morphologically and identify morphological features to differentiate thyroid tumors with RAS-like mutations from encapsulated papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) with predominant follicular growth and BRAFV600E mutation. Methods: Representative whole slide images of 16 encapsulated thyroid tumors with predominant follicular growth were reviewed by 12 thyroid pathologists using a web browser-based image viewer. Total nuclear score was calculated from semi-quantitatively scored eight nuclear features. The molecular profile of RAS and BRAF genes was determined by Sanger sequencing. Results: Total nuclear score ranging 0 to 24 could differentiate BRAF-like tumors from RAS-like tumors with a cut-off value of score 14. The interobserver agreement was the highest for the assessment of nuclear pseudoinclusions (NPIs) but the lowest for nuclear elongation and sickle-shaped nuclei. NPIs were found in tumors with BRAFV600E mutation, but not in tumors with RAS-like mutations. Total nuclear scores were significantly higher for tumors with BRAFV600E than for those with RAS-like mutations (P<0.001). Conclusion: Our results suggest that NPIs and high nuclear scores have diagnostic utility as rule-in markers for differentiating PTC with BRAFV600E mutation from benign or borderline follicular tumors with RAS-like mutations. Relaxation of rigid criteria for nuclear features resulted in an overdiagnosis of PTC. Immunostaining or molecular testing for BRAFV600E mutation is a useful adjunct for cases with high nuclear scores to identify true PTC.', 'Noninvasive Follicular Thyroid Neoplasm with Papillary-Like Nuclear Features in Asian Practice: Perspectives for Surgical Pathology and Cytopathology  2018, The Author(s).The introduction of noninvasive follicular thyroid neoplasm with papillary-like nuclear features (NIFTP) was initiated and promoted by pathologists. Recent Asian studies added new knowledge to the existing literature to aid a better understanding of NIFTP. Our original data and the results of a meta-analysis suggest that the initial rate of NIFTP has been overestimated, averaging 9.1% (95% confidence interval [CI] 6.0–12.7%) of all papillary thyroid cancers worldwide. The incidence of NIFTP in the Asian population (1.6%, 95% CI 0.9–2.5%; 7 studies) is significantly lower than that reported in the non-Asian series (13.3%, 95% CI 9.0–18.3%; 18 studies). Such difference could be attributed to various perceptions of histological diagnostic thresholds, different nature of papillary thyroid carcinoma, and different approaches in the management of thyroid nodules. The active surveillance for indeterminate nodules and NIFTP, largely represented in the indeterminate cytologic categories, promoted by Japanese institutions establishes a new paradigm to reduce overtreatment of these patients. The lower prevalence of NIFTP in the Asian series indicates a low impact on the risk of malignancy in cytopathology, as it was demonstrated in our original multi-institutional cohort of thyroid nodules, and may predict a low impact on the performance of commercial molecular tests. Several Korean studies addressed the issue of BRAF mutation in NIFTP, which prompted the current refinement of the diagnostic criteria for NIFTP. Our survey of Asian pathologists found that the term NIFTP has not been universally adopted in the local practice. Endocrine pathologists must promote the new entity through provision of educational activities.', 'Impact of non-invasive follicular thyroid neoplasm with papillary-like nuclear features on the Bethesda system for reporting thyroid cytopathology: a multi-institutional study in five Asian countries  2018 Royal College of Pathologists of AustralasiaSeveral Western studies showed that the recent introduction of non-invasive follicular thyroid neoplasm with papillary-like nuclear features (NIFTP) significantly decreased risk of malignancy for cytological diagnostic categories. We aimed to determine the impact of NIFTP on risk of malignancy within a cohort of thyroid nodules from Asian countries, and to compare distribution of diagnostic categories between NIFTP and invasive encapsulated follicular variant of papillary thyroid carcinoma (eFV-PTC). Consecutive thyroid fine-needle aspirates from six institutions were retrospectively analysed. Histopathology slides with a diagnosis of eFV-PTC were reviewed and reclassified into invasive eFV-PTC and NIFTP. The risk of malignancy was calculated with and without NIFTP. Of 11,372 thyroid nodules, 2044 had available surgical follow-up. NIFTP was diagnosed in 59 cases, which constituted 2.9% of all excised nodules, and 5.3% of malignant nodules. Preoperative cytological diagnoses for NIFTP were non-diagnostic (10.2%), benign (18.6%), atypia of undetermined significance/follicular lesion of undetermined significance (22.0%), follicular neoplasm/suspicious for follicular neoplasm (FN/SFN) (32.2%), suspicious for malignancy (SM) (11.9%), and malignant (5.1%). The only category which showed a relative reduction in risk of malignancy after reclassification of more than 20%, was FN/SFN (24.4%). There was a significantly higher prevalence of benign cytology in NIFTP (p = 0.04) and SM/malignant in invasive eFV-PTC (p = 0.05). A majority of NIFTP cases were classified in indeterminate categories, which decreased the corresponding risk of malignancy. However, the magnitude of NIFTP impact was much lower than in the Western reports. Asian countries may not experience significant effects of NIFTP reclassification on the practice of thyroid cytopathology.']"

In addition, for the past decade more and more organizations have been adopting iterative and incremental software development approaches to handle rapid requirement changes in software requirements and to accelerate their products to the market. These factors have pushed tons of pressure on software testing, especially in the regression testing step. Regression testing is a pivotal step to ensure that code alterations do not impact the existing functionalities of the software. As software grows larger, regression testing could become impractical, if done manually, since human resource consumption would exponentially increase. To alleviate this issue, many organizations have embraced automation testing in their regression testing steps.

Pakchong 1, was pretreated in an ionic liquid mixture through microwave irradiation. To improve the fermentable sugar yield, an acid catalyzed aqueous ionic liquid pretreatment was applied to maximize the total sugar conversion of pretreated Napier grass. Additionally, to optimize the fermentable sugar yield, experiments were carried out employing response surface methodology (RSM). The study showed that a maximum fermentable sugar concentration of 15.72 g/L could be predicted from the model when Napier grass was pretreated by 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium acetate ([EMIM] [OAc]) 50% (v/v) aqueous mixture combined with 1.287% (v/v) acetic acid at a microwave pretreatment temperature and time of 147 °C and 76 min, respectively. The experiments confirmed that the maximum sugar concentration obtained from acidic aqueous ionic liquid pretreatment were 14.38 g/L under the optimal conditions. The results from the Fourier transmission infrared spectroscopic showed that an acid catalyzed aqueous ionic liquid pretreatment removed large fractions of lignin.', 'Comparison of acid-, alkaline-, and ionic liquid–treated Napier grass as an immobilization carrier for butanol production by Clostridium beijerinckii JCM 8026  2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.Immobilization is a simple technique in which microorganisms adhere and agglomerate onto the porous material’s surface, resulting in a higher cell density, cell tolerance, and productivity. Acetone-butanol-ethanol (ABE) fermentation using immobilized Clostridium beijerinckii JCM 8026 on Napier grass (Pennisetum purpureum) chemically pretreated with H2SO4, NaOH, and 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium acetate (EMIM-OAc) was compared in order to investigate the effect of the treatment on butanol production. X-ray diffraction, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, and surface area measurement analyses indicated that the alkaline-pretreated Napier grass sample had the highest crystalline level with the lowest lignin content (lignin/cellulose) and a high surface area compared with other pretreated samples, suggesting its potential as an immobilized material. The fermentation was operated in a batch system for 5 days with an initial glucose level of 60 g/L. Clostridium beijerinckii JCM 8026 immobilized on the NaOH-treated Napier grass gave the highest butanol concentration (8.99 g/L), which corresponded to a 24.7% and 25.6% higher concentration than that when the cells were immobilized on untreated Napier grass and free cell culture, respectively. It is likely that immobilization on NaOH-treated Napier grass increased the cells’ protection from environmental stresses and prevented their washing out due to its swollen structure within an enlarged surface area.', 'Evaluation of different pretreatments of Napier grass for enzymatic saccharification and ethanol production  2018 The Authors. Energy Science & Engineering published by the Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.Due to its fast-growing and high carbohydrate content, Napier grass has a great potential to be chosen as a raw material for renewable energy production. The Napier grass after different pretreatments was tested for simultaneous saccharification and fermentation (SSF) with dried yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) and cellulase (CTec2) to produce ethanol. For alkaline pretreatment, the grass was incubated with 10% NaOH at a ratio of 1:20 (w/v) at 90°C for 1 hour. For dilute acid pretreatment, the grass was soaked with 1% H2SO4 at a ratio of 1:10 (w/v) and incubated at 120°C for 1 hour. For the two-stage pretreatment, the resultant solid from dilute acid pretreatment was further treated with 2% NaOH (1:10 w/v) at 80°C for 6 hours. After enzymatic saccharification at 50°C and pH 5.0 for 96 hours using CTec2, yields of glucose from three pretreated Napier grass samples (10% water-insoluble solids, WIS) were 75.4 ± 2.9%, 55.4 ± 6.5%, and 76.4 ± 5.0%. Using 10% WIS of alkaline-pretreated Napier grass biomass as the substrate, the 72-hour SSF led to an ethanol yield of 86.6 ± 3.4%. On the basis of the dried biomass of Napier grass as the raw material, the ethanol yield could reach 0.143 ± 0.006 (g/g). Napier grass biomass could be effectively treated by alkaline, dilute acid, or two-stage pretreatment methods to remove non-cellulosic components to some extent. Alkaline pretreatment was found to be superior to dilute acid and two-stage pretreatment methods, based on ethanol yields obtained under similar SSF conditions.']"

Indigenous plants including Garcinia mangostana play a vital role in human health and well being. Many species of this plant have been reported with myriads of potent medicinal properties. However, the aims of this study were, for the first time, to isolate compounds from the flower of G. mangostana and to test their anti-Acanthamoeba and anti-adhesion activity against Acanthamoeba triangularis. Powdered flowers of G. mangostana were extracted and chromatographed on a silica gel column. The structures of the compounds were established with the aid of 1H NMR. More so, the anti-Acanthamoeba and anti-adhesion properties were tested on a 96-well polystyrene microtiter plate and soft contact lenses. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) was used to determine the features of A. triangularis on contact lenses. Eight pure compounds were obtained, namely 9-hydroxycalabaxanthone, tovophillin A, garcinone E, garcinone B, α-mangostin, gartinin, 8-deoxygartinin and γ-mangostin. The extract and pure compounds exhibited anti-Acanthamoeba activity with MIC values in the range of 0.25–1 mg/mL. In addition, the extract and α-mangostin displayed significant activity against the adhesion of A. triangularis trophozoites both in polystyrene plate and in contact lenses at 0.5 × MIC (0.25 mg/mL). Furthermore, α-mangostin has the potential to remove A. triangularis adhesion in contact lenses similar to a commercial multipurpose solution (MPS). SEM study confirmed that crude extract and α-mangostin are effective as solutions for contact lenses, which removed A. triangularis trophozoites within 24 h. Alpha-mangostin was non-toxic to Vero cells at a concentration below 39 μM in 24 h. Crude extract of G. mangostana flower and its α-mangostin serve as candidate compounds in the treatment of Acanthamoeba infection or as lens care solution, since they can be used as a source of natural products against Acanthamoeba and virulence factor associated with the adhesion of A. triangularis.', 'Anti-Acanthamoeba synergistic effect of chlorhexidine and Garcinia mangostana extract or α-mangostin against Acanthamoeba triangularis trophozoite and cyst forms  2021, The Author(s).Acanthamoeba spp. can cause amoebic keratitis (AK). Chlorhexidine is effective for AK treatment as monotherapy, but with a relative failure on drug bioavailability in the deep corneal stroma. The combination of chlorhexidine and propamidine isethionate is recommended in the current AK treatment. However, the effectiveness of treatment depends on the parasite and virulence strains. This study aims to determine the potential of Garcinia mangostana pericarp extract and α-mangostin against Acanthamoeba triangularis, as well as the combination with chlorhexidine in the treatment of Acanthamoeba infection. The minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of the extract and α-mangostin were assessed in trophozoites with 0.25 and 0.5 mg/mL, for cysts with 4 and 1 mg/mL, respectively. The MIC of the extract and α-mangostin inhibited the growth of A. triangularis trophozoites and cysts for up to 72 h. The extract and α-mangostin combined with chlorhexidine demonstrated good synergism, resulting in a reduction of 1/4–1/16 of the MIC. The SEM results showed that Acanthamoeba cells treated with a single drug and its combination caused damage to the cell membrane and irregular cell shapes. A good combination displayed by the extract or α-mangostin and chlorhexidine, described for the first time. Therefore, this approach is promising as an alternative method for the management of Acanthamoeba infection in the future.', 'Acute toxicity and teratogenicity of α-mangostin in zebrafish embryos  2019 by the Society for Experimental Biology and Medicine. α-Mangostin is the most active compound derived from the pericarps of mangosteen. A number of studies have reported its anticancer activity. However, only a few studies have investigated the toxicity of this compound; moreover, the teratogenicity of α-mangostin has not been reported. In this study, we evaluated the effects of α-mangostin on the development of zebrafish embryos. The exposure of zebrafish embryos to α-mangostin for 72 h dose-dependently induced mortality and abnormal development. The derived LC 50 value of α-mangostin to zebrafish embryos at 72 h was 5.75 ± 0.26 μmol/L. We observed teratogenic effects in α-mangostin-treated embryos, characterized by axis malformation, bent tail, pericardial edema, yolk sac edema, sluggish circulation, and heart malformation. The percentages of the malformed embryos were 78.79% and 100% at 4.5 and 6 μM, respectively. α-Mangostin exposure also caused hemostasis in the ducts of Cuvier and a decreased heart rate in zebrafish embryos at 48 and 72 h post-fertilization. These results indicated that α-mangostin induced cardiac dysfunction in zebrafish embryos. In addition, a sub-lethal concentration and a lethal concentration (3 and 6 μM, respectively) were used to assess the compound effects on oxidative stress and embryonic erythropoiesis. α-Mangostin was found to decrease the level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in zebrafish embryos. Furthermore, hemoglobin staining revealed a decrease in hemoglobin, which suggested that α-mangostin disrupted embryonic erythropoiesis in zebrafish. To our knowledge, the results of this study, for the first time, demonstrated that α-mangostin was potentially teratogenic and could disrupt embryonic ROS balance and erythropoiesis. Impact statement: α-Mangostin has been reported to have anticancer properties both in vitro and in vivo models. Although there are several studies that evaluated the toxicity of the compound in rodent models, we are the first to evaluate the teratogenicity of α-mangostin. In the present work, we found that α-mangostin induced mortality and malformations in zebrafish embryos. In addition, we exhibited that the compound also disrupted the reactive oxygen species and hemoglobin levels. These findings suggest that α-mangostin may possibly cause the same adverse effects on human health. The mechanisms of these toxicological effects of the compound will be further elucidated and the effects found in zebrafish embryos need to be verified in other animal models.']"

Implants can be placed through conventional freehand, static computer-assisted implant surgery (CAIS), or dynamic CAIS protocols, but at present there is very limited clinical evidence on their accuracy in fully edentulous patients. This study was performed to evaluate the accuracy of implant placement using three protocols in fully edentulous patients. Thirteen patients received 60 implants with the freehand (n = 20), static CAIS (n = 20), or dynamic CAIS (n = 20) protocol. Postoperative cone beam computed tomography was utilized to evaluate the accuracy of implant placement in relation to the planned optimal position. The data were analysed by ANCOVA followed by Bonferroni analysis. The mean angular deviation (standard deviation) in the freehand, static CAIS, and dynamic CAIS groups was 10.09° (4.64°), 4.98° (2.16°), and 5.75° (2.09°), respectively.

Purpose: To compare the accuracy of position and parallelism of two implants, using static and dynamic CAIS systems. Materials and methods: Thirty patients received two implants (60 implants) randomly allocated to two different CAIS systems. Optimal implant position and absolute parallelism was planned based on preoperative cone beam CT (CBCT). Patients received implants with a surgical guide (static CAIS, n = 30) or real-time navigation (dynamic CAIS, n = 30). Implant three-dimensional deviation and parallelism was calculated after surgery. Results: The mean 3D deviation in the static and dynamic CAIS group at implant platform were 1.04 ± 0.67 vs 1.24 ± 0.39 mm, at apex were 1.54 ± 0.79 vs 1.58 ± 0.56 mm and angulation were 4.08° ± 1.69° vs 3.78° ± 1.84°, respectively. The angle deviations between two placed implants (parallelism) in static and dynamic CAIS groups were 4.32° ± 2.44° and 3.55° ± 2.29°, respectively.

Materials and methods: A total of 60 patients in need of a single implant were randomly assigned to two CAIS groups (Static n = 30, Dynamic n = 30) and implants were placed by one surgeon. Preoperative CBCT was transferred to implant planning software to plan the optimal implant position. Implants were placed using either stereolithographic guide template (Static CAIS) or implant navigation system (Dynamic CAIS). Postoperative CBCT was imported to implant planning software, and deviation analysis with the planned position was performed. Primary outcomes were the deviation measurements at implant platform, apex, and angle of placement. Secondary outcome was the distribution of the implant deviation into each 3D direction. Results: The mean deviation at implant platform and implant apex in the static CAIS group was 0.97 ± 0.44 mm and 1.28 ± 0.46 mm, while that in the dynamic CAIS group was 1.05 ± 0.44 mm and 1.29 ± 0.50 mm, respectively. The angular deviation in static and dynamic CAIS group was 2.84 ± 1.71 degrees and 3.06 ± 1.37 degrees. None of the above differences between the two groups reached statistical significance. The deviation of implants toward the mesial direction in dynamic CAIS group was significantly higher than that of the static CAIS (p = 0.032). Conclusions: Implant placement accuracy in single tooth space using dynamic CAIS appear to be the same to that of static CAIS. (Thai Clinical Trials Registry TCTR20180826001).']"

In this multi-national study (40 countries; 7443 participants), we investigate how societal pressure to be happy and not sad predicts emotional, cognitive and clinical indicators of well-being around the world, and examine how these relations differ as a function of countries’ national happiness levels (collected from the World Happiness Report). Although detrimental well-being associations manifest for an average country, the strength of these relations varies across countries. People’s felt societal pressure to be happy and not sad is particularly linked to poor well-being in countries with a higher World Happiness Index.

In addition, different ratios of polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) with ZIF-8 were also investigated. The textural properties of adsorbents were analyzed by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscope (SEM), and Quantachrom/Autosorb1-MP. All adsorbents were microporous materials. ZIF-8 has uniform crystalline structure, which is different from the amorphous structure of activated carbon. The result showed the increase in the methane and carbon dioxide adsorption when the pressure increased. ZIF-8 (pure) showed higher methane and carbon dioxide adsorption capacity than the activated carbon corresponding to its surface area, micropore volume, and average pore diameter. The addition of PVDF decreased the methane uptake. Furthermore, ZIF-8 (pure) and activated carbon adsorbed carbon dioxide more than methane, approximately twice due to its preferential adsorption towards carbon dioxide.', 'Separation of nitrogen dioxide from the gas mixture with nitrogen by use of ZIF materials; computer simulation studies  2019 Elsevier B.V.The separation of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) from the gas mixture with nitrogen (N2) by selective adsorption and diffusion in three Zeolitic Imidazolate Frameworks (ZIFs) is examined by Gibbs Ensemble Monte Carlo (GEMC) and Molecular Dynamics (MD) computer simulations at 373 K, which is a temperature that can be found in the exhaust gases of combustion engines and furnaces. This temperature ensures that the chemical equilibrium reaction between NO2 and N2O4 can be neglected since at this temperature almost only NO2 exists. At 373 K, the membrane selectivity of NO2 over N2 is predicted to be about 4.2 (ZIF-90), 5.2 (ZIF-8), and 10.6 (ZIF-78). In addition, it is shown that N2O4 can be neither adsorbed nor diffuses inside these ZIF materials, which makes these ZIFs a promising materials for separation by membranes. Due to molecular sieving, only N2 and NO2 can pass the ZIF membranes.', 'Enhanced CO2 capturing over ultra-microporous carbon with nitrogen-active species prepared using one-step carbonization of polybenzoxazine for a sustainable environment  2018Nitrogen-enriched porous carbon has been a promising material for CO2 capture in the recent decades. To enhance the performance of CO2 adsorption, both an N-active site and the textural properties are crucial determinants. Herein, ultra-microporous carbon with N-active species was prepared using two synthesis procedures: 1) one-step carbonization of a polybenzoxazine (PBZ) precursor at 800 °C, and 2) the CO2 activation process at 900 °C. The activated porous carbon had the higher specific surface area (943 m2/g) and a total pore volume (0.51 cm3/g) compared to un-activated porous carbon (335 m2/g and 0.19 cm3/g, respectively). In addition, the presence of N-active species such as pyridine-N, secondary-N, pyridone-N, and oxide-N in the carbon structures could be clearly observed in the high-resolution XPS spectra. The CO2 adsorption measurement was performed at 30 and 50 °C under a wide range of pressures (1–7 bar). The maximum amount of CO2 uptake was ca. 3.59 mmol/g for the activated porous carbon operated at 30 °C and a CO2 pressure of 7 bar, which was due to the high specific surface area and the large micropore volume. Specifically, carbon with a 3D interconnected pore structure, derived from the sol-gel process of the PBZ precursor, exhibited good structural stability and consequently led to better absorption capability under the high atmospheric pressure of CO2. The enhanced CO2 adsorption capability for the as-prepared porous carbon was based on two mechanisms: physisorption as a result of textural properties and chemisorption as a result of the acid-base interaction between the basic N functionality and the acidic CO2 gas. All results suggested that ultra-microporous carbon with N-active species prepared from polybenzoxazine is a promising adsorbent for CO2 capture and storage, which can be used at a wide range of pressures and in many applications e.g. flue gas adsorption and natural gas production.']"

The objective of this study was to comparatively analyze the expression and significance of SOX2 and OCT4 in various types of odontogenic cysts and tumors. Methods: Fifty-five cases of odontogenic cysts and tumors, including 15 ameloblastomas (AM), 5 adenomatoid odontogenic tumors (AOT), 5 ameloblastic fibromas (AF), 5 calcifying odontogenic cysts (COC), 10 dentigerous cysts (DC) and 15 odontogenic keratocysts (OKC) were investigated for the expression of SOX2 and OCT4 immunohistochemically. Results: Most OKCs (86.7 %) and all AFs expressed SOX2 in more than 50 % of epithelial cells. Its immunoreactivity was moderate-to-strong in all epithelial cell types in both lesions. In contrast, SOX2 expression was undetectable in AOTs and limited to the ameloblast-like cells in a minority of AM and COC cases. Most DCs showed positive staining in less than 25 % of cystic epithelium. Significantly greater SOX2 expression was noted in OKC compared with DC or AM, and in AF compared with COC or AOT. OCT4 rarely expressed in odontogenic lesions with the immunoreactivity being mild and present exclusively in OKCs. Conclusions: SOX2 is differentially expressed in odontogenic cysts and tumors. This could be related to their diverse cells of origin or stages of histogenesis. The overexpression of SOX2 and OCT4 in OKC indicates the acquired stem-like property.

Materials and Methods Seventy samples of odontogenic cysts samples were immunohistochemically stained to detect claudin-1,-4, and-7 expression. Patient information and OKC recurrence data were recorded. The staining was analyzed semiquantitatively and categorized based on the pattern and percentage of positively stained cystic epithelial cells. Statistical Analysis Expression of different claudins between groups was analyzed using the Kruskal-Wallis test with Dunn's test, followed by post hoc pairwise comparison. The association between claudin expression and OKC recurrence was analyzed by the Mann-Whitney U test. Correlations among claudin expression were examined with Spearman's correlation coefficient. Level of significance was at p < 0.005. Results Claudin-1 was widely expressed in every odontogenic cyst. Most DCs (50%) expressed claudin-1 in more than 75% of cells, as did RCs (65%), while most OKCs (50%) expressed claudin-1 in 26 to 50% of cells. Most COCs (50%) expressed claudin-1 in 51 to 75% of cells. Every sample of OKC and RC was positive for claudin-4, but no sample showed staining in more than 51% of cells. Every odontogenic cyst was positive for claudin-7. DCs (35%), OKCs (55%), and RCs (40%) mostly showed staining in 26 to 50% of cells. High claudin-1 expression was shown in COCs, DCs, and RCs, while low expression of claudin-4 was shown in every odontogenic cyst. For claudin-7, the expression is high only in COCs. Claudin-1 and-4 was significantly different among each odontogenic cyst. High expression of claudin-1 was correlated with OKC recurrence. The correlations of claudin-1 with claudin-7 expression and claudin-4 with claudin-7 expression were significant in DCs. In COCs, claudin-1 and claudin-7 expression was significantly correlated. Conclusions The expression of claudin-1,-4, and-7 was present in every odontogenic cyst, but the proportion of positive staining cells was different.

The objectives of this study were to analyze the claudin-1, -4 and -7 expression in odontogenic tumors and characterize their expression pattern in distinct tumor cell types in relation to the recurrence potential. Sixty-nine cases of odontogenic tumors, including 43 ameloblastomas (AM), 17 adenomatoid odontogenic tumors (AOT), 6 ameloblastic fibromas (AF) and 3 ameloblastic carcinomas (AC) were investigated for claudin-1, -4 and -7 expression immunohistochemically. The staining was analyzed semi-quantitatively and categorized into 4 levels, based on the percentage of positively stained neoplastic epithelial cells. Claudin-1 was expressed in all AOT and AF cases, whereas most AC (66.7%) showed no expression. The claudin-1 staining was moderate-to-intense in the odontogenic epithelium of AF. In contrast, its staining of ameloblast-like cells and stellate reticulum-like cells in AM was weak. Claudin-7 expression was noted in all tumor types studied, while the expression of claudin-4 was limited and mainly localized in the squamous differentiated cells of AM and AC. AM showed significantly higher claudin-4, but lower claudin-7 expression than AOT. In addition, AC showed diminished claudin-1 immunoreactivity, compared to AOT. Low claudin-1 expression in AM was significantly associated with the increased clinical recurrence. The loss of claudin-1 may underlie the locally invasive nature of AM.']"

Results: After 4 weeks of both stretching protocols, participants in group 2 demonstrated a significantly greater pressure pain threshold than participants in group 1 (P =.040) with post hoc analysis. No significant differences between groups were demonstrated in other variables (P >.05). Concerning within-group comparisons, both interventions resulted in significant reductions in pain at first step in the morning and average pain at the medial plantar calcaneal region over the past 24 hours, while there were increases in the pressure pain threshold, visual analog scale–foot and ankle score, and range of motion in ankle dorsiflexion (P <.001). More participants in group 2 described their symptoms as being much improved to being completely improved than those in group 1. Conclusion: The simultaneous stretching of the Achilles tendon and plantar fascia for 4 weeks was a more effective intervention for plantar fasciitis. Patients who reported complete relief from symptoms at the end of the 4-week intervention in the simultaneous stretching group (n = 14; 56%) were double that of the stretching of the Achilles tendon–only group (n = 7; 28%). Level of Evidence: II, lesser quality RCT or prospective comparative study.', 'Physical and psychological predictors on pain intensity in conscripts with plantar fasciitis  2019Background: Plantar fasciitis is commonly found among the physically active population, including conscripts. Some studies have reported that being overweight and having psychological symptoms contribute to pain from plantar fasciitis. However, there is a lack of information regarding the physical predictors, and more research is needed to determine the relationship between such predictors and pain intensity from plantar fasciitis in conscripts. Objective: To determine which physical and psychological variables act as predictors of pain intensity among Thai novice conscripts with plantar fasciitis. Methods: Two hundred and seventy Thai novice conscripts without musculoskeletal pain completed the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale short version and then received baseline assessment of ankle dorsiflexion angle, ankle plantarflexor strength, and quality of lower extremity movement from a physical therapist. After 10 weeks of military training, 71 of these Thai conscripts developed pain from plantar fasciitis. Multiple linear regression analysis with the forward stepwise method was used to explore the predictors of pain intensity due to plantar fasciitis. Results: Using a forward regression analysis, anxiety (B = 0.13; 95% CI, 0.06–0.20; p < 0.01) and quality of movement score (B = 0.87; 95% CI, 0.28–1.47; p = 0.01) were significant predictors of pain intensity. The regression model with these predictors explained 25% of the variability in pain intensity from plantar fasciitis. Conclusion: Higher scores of anxiety and movement quality on the lateral step-down task were associated with pain intensity from plantar fasciitis after the completion of a 10-week military program. However, lower ankle dorsiflexion angle and ankle plantarflexor strength did not predict pain intensity.', 'Differences in lower-extremity kinematics between the male military personnel with and without plantar fasciitis  2021 Elsevier LtdObjective: To evaluate the factors that influence gait by comparing lower extremity kinematics during the stance phase of the gait cycle between individuals with and without plantar fasciitis. Design: A cross-sectional study. Setting: Motion analysis research laboratory. Participants: Thirty subjects with plantar fasciitis and 30 aged-matched controls. Main outcome measure(s): Range of motion of the lower extremity and multi-segment foot during gait using a three-dimensional motion analysis system. Results: The plantar fasciitis group showed significant differences in motion in the multi-segment foot, ankle, knee, and hip from the control group during various subphases of the stance phase. Specifically, relative to the control group, the plantar fasciitis group had more rearfoot adduction, forefoot eversion, ankle abduction, and hip abduction. They also had less midfoot dorsiflexion, forefoot dorsiflexion, knee extension, knee external rotation, and hip extension (all Ps < 0.05). Conclusions: Individuals with plantar fasciitis exhibited more flexibility in the ankle-foot complex and poorer quality of lower-extremity movement than the group that did not have plantar fasciitis. Thus, differences in structures in both the ankle-foot complex as well as those in the hip and knee joints appear to be associated with the presence of plantar fasciitis.']"

Particularly, the existence of non-photoactive δ-phase FAPbI3 has been considered detrimental to regular-structured perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Here, in hole-conductor-free triple-mesoscopic PSCs, we observe that α-phase FAPbI3 transforms to δ-phase FAPbI3 at the perovskite/carbon interface and in situ forms an α/δ-phase junction when the as-fabricated cells are exposed to humid atmosphere. The α/δ-phase junction shows a favorable band alignment and significantly suppresses the charge recombination at the interface. By controlling the relative humidity of the atmosphere, we fabricate FAPbI3-based cells that deliver a champion efficiency of 17.11% with an enhanced open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 1020 mV. This work demonstrates the potential of δ-phase FAPbI3 for benefiting the device performance of PSCs and proposes the concept of constructing perovskite-based junctions at the interface between a perovskite-absorbing layer and charge-transporting layers for enhancing the VOC of PSCs.', 'Effects of anti-solvent in the two-step fabrication of absorber layer in perovskite solar cells  Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.Hybrid organic-inorganic perovskite materials, e.g., CH3NH3PbI3 (MAPbI3) have been used as photon absorber layer in the emerging solar cell technology.

All rights reserved.As of recent years, triple-cation perovskite solar cells have received immense attention due to its superior efficiency and better stability comparing to the classic single-cation perovskite solar cells such as MAPbI3 or FAPbI3. A triple-cation perovskite layer which has been used most recently is cesium-containing FAPbI3-based perovskite. One of decent approaches to fabricate the layer is spin-coating technique by using two-step deposition process in which mixed lead-halide and CsI precursor is firstly spin-coated onto a substrate, then organic cation solution is deposited on the lead-halide layer. In this work, the results show that the performance of the devices from this process is lower than expected that could be due to difficulty of cesium ion incorporation as a stabilizer for FAPbI3-based perovskite. Perovskite seeding growth is introduced to solve the problem where the process is slightly modified from conventional two-step deposition methods by adding small amount of perovskite seed precursor into PbI2 solution. The concentration of the perovskite seed in PbI2 solution was varied for 0, 7, 14 and 20% v/v. The highest average efficiency of 11.9% was obtained from 7% v/v seeding concentration. Furthermore, the device performance could be improved by using proper amount of chlorobenzene (CB) as an anti-solvent. The highest efficiency of 18.4% was achieved by using 30 µl of chlorobenzene.']"

To retard the degradation due to a direct supply of CH4, the Ni/YSZ has been modified with the incorporation of Co into the Ni matrix, forming a substitutional solid-solution alloy. As a result, the porous anode exhibits well-connected compositional grains owing to the Co3O4 precursor as a sintering aid. The 25 mol% Co incorporation producing the Ni0.75Co0.25/YSZ anode significantly improves the cell performance and prolonged stability. In addition, the Ni0.75Co0.25/YSZ anode provides the apparent activation energy of the charge transfer reaction to a lower value in the electrochemical oxidation of CH4 at the triple-phase boundary. However, the apparent activation energy decrease is not identified for H2.

House dust mite (HDM) allergy is frequent around the world, the sensitization profile to individual HDM allergens varies in individual HDM-allergic patients (APs). The aim of this study was to evaluate the pattern of IgE sensitization to three major Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus (Dp) allergens among patients from North Eastern Poland suffering from HDM-AR and/or AA. Patients and methods: The study was performed on 323 HDM-AR and/or AA patients and 106 controls (CG) including 30 healthy non-atopic subjects, 32 AR patients not sensitized to Dp and 44 non-atopic asthmatics. IgE levels to natural (n)Der p 1, nDer p 2, recombinant (r)Der p 2.0101 and rDer p 23 allergens were measured by ELISA. Results: The majority of HDM-APs were sensitized to nDer p 1 (72.1%), nDer p 2 (81.7%), rDer p 2.0101 (78.3%) and rDer p 23 (70.9%). The frequency of positive results to individual allergens depended on clinical manifestations and the level of IgE to the whole Dp extract. In HDM-AA patients, reactivity to nDer p 1 and rDer p 23 was detected more frequently than in HDM-AR patients. The whole Dp extract completely inhibited IgE binding to nDer p 1 and nDer p 2 but only partially to rDer p 23. Conclusions: HDM-APs from North-Eastern Poland display sensitization profile to major allergens which is similarly observed in western Europe. HDM-based diagnostic and therapeutic products should include all major allergens.', 'Der p 1-specific regulatory T-cell response during house dust mite allergen immunotherapy  2018 EAACI and John Wiley and Sons A/S. Published by John Wiley and Sons Ltd.Background: Allergen-specific immunotherapy (AIT) is the only available treatment for allergic diseases that can induce specific immune tolerance to allergens. The key mechanisms involved in this process include changes in allergen-specific regulatory T (Treg) cells. Methods: We studied 25 allergic rhinitis patients undergoing subcutaneous house dust mite–specific immunotherapy. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were studied before and after 10, 30 weeks, and 3 years of AIT. Der p 1-specific T regulatory cell responses were investigated by characterization of Der p 1-MHC class II tetramer–positive cells and correlated with nasal symptom score. Results: Twelve of 25 AIT patients matched with their MHC class II expression to the Der p 1 peptide-MHC class II tetramers. A significant increase in the numbers of Der p 1-specific FOXP3+Helios+CD25+CD127− Treg cells after 30 weeks was observed, which slightly decreased after 3 years of AIT. In contrast, Der p 1-specific immunoglobulin-like transcript 3 (ILT3)+CD25+ Treg cells decreased substantially from baseline after 3 years of AIT. ILT3+ Treg cells displayed compromised suppressive function and low FOXP3 expression. In addition, Der p 1-specific IL-10 and IL-22 responses have increased after 30 weeks, but only IL-10+ Der p 1-specific Treg cells remained present at high frequency after 3 years of AIT. Increased number of FOXP3+Helios+ and IL-10+ and decreased ILT3+ Treg cell responses correlated with improved allergic symptoms. Conclusion: The results indicate that AIT involves upregulation of the activated allergen-specific Treg cells and downregulation of dysfunctional allergen-specific Treg cell subset. Correction of dysregulated Treg cells responses during AIT is associated with improved clinical response.', 'Recombinant T-cell epitope conjugation: A new approach for Dermatophagoides hypoallergen design  2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.Background: Allergen-specific immunotherapy (AIT) is the only clinical approach that can potentially cure some allergic diseases by inducing immunological tolerance. Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus is considered as the most important source of mite allergens worldwide, with high sensitization rates for the major allergens Der p 1, Der p 2 and Der p 23. The aim of this work is to generate a hypoallergenic hybrid molecule containing T-cell epitopes from these three major allergens. Methods: The hybrid protein termed Der p 2231 containing T-cell epitopes was purified by affinity chromatography. The human IgE reactivity was verified by comparing those with the parental allergens. The hybrid was also characterized immunologically through an in vivo mice model. Results: The hybrid rDer p 2231 stimulated in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) isolated from allergic patients with higher levels of IL- 2, IL-10, IL-15 and IFN-γ, as well as lower levels of IL-4, IL-5, IL-13, TNF-α and GM-CSF. The use of hybrid molecules as a therapeutic model in D. pteronyssinus allergic mice led to the reduction of IgE production and lower eosinophilic peroxidase activity in the airways. We found increased levels of IgG antibodies that blocked the IgE binding to the parental allergens in the serum of allergic patients. Furthermore, the stimulation of splenocytes from mice treated with rDer p 2231 induced higher levels of IL-10 and IFN-γ and decreased the secretion of IL-4 and IL-5, when compared with parental allergens and D. pteronyssinus extract. Conclusions: rDer p 2231 has the potential to be used in AIT in patients co-sensitized with D. pteronyssinus major allergens, once it was able to reduce IgE production, inducing allergen-specific blocking antibodies, restoring and balancing Th1/Th2 immune responses, and inducing regulatory T-cells.']"

We studied the natural history and evaluated the performance of prognostic models in ACLF patients. Methods: Prospectively collected data of ACLF patients from APASL-ACLF Research Consortium (AARC) was analyzed for 30-day outcomes. The models evaluated at days 0, 4, and 7 of presentation for 30-day mortality were: AARC (model and score), CLIF-C (ACLF score, and OF score), NACSELD-ACLF (model and binary), SOFA, APACHE-II, MELD, MELD-Lactate, and CTP. Evaluation parameters were discrimination (c-indices), calibration [accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and positive/negative predictive values (PPV/NPV)], Akaike/Bayesian Information Criteria (AIC/BIC), Nagelkerke-R2, relative prediction errors, and odds ratios. Results: Thirty-day survival of the cohort (n = 2864) was 64.9% and was lowest for final-AARC-grade-III (32.8%) ACLF. Performance parameters of all models were best at day 7 than at day 4 or day 0 (p < 0.05 for C-indices of all models except NACSELD-ACLF). On comparison, day-7 AARC model had the numerically highest c-index 0.872, best accuracy 84.0%, PPV 87.8%, R2 0.609 and lower prediction errors by 10–50%.

However, this criteria has not yet been studied in Asia, where chronic hepatitis infection is more prevalent. We aimed to determine the outcome of Thai patients with ACLF and validate the CLIF-C organ failure (CLIF-C OF) score for ACLF diagnosis and CLIF-ACLF score for predicting prognosis. Materials and Methods: We prospectively enrolled cirrhotic patients hospitalized with acute decompensation (AD). Primary end point was 3-month mortality. Factors associated with mortality were determined using logistic regression analysis. Results: We enrolled 95 cirrhotic patients with mean age of 56 years. The most common etiology of cirrhosis was chronic viral hepatitis (48.5%) and alcoholism (44.2%). Forty patients (42%) were diagnosed with ACLF. The 3-month mortality rate was well correlated with the 3 ACLF subclasses, i.e. 45.5%, 53.6% and 80%, respectively. From the multivariate analysis, CLIF-ACLF score was the only independent predictor for the 3-month mortality in the ACLF group (adjusted OR 1.114, p = 0.008). Additionally, CLIF-ACLF score had the AUROC of 0.78 which was significantly higher than the other 4 scores studied (p<0.05).

Methods: This retrospective cohort study collected data from multicenter tertiary care hospitals in Thailand. A total of 638 hospitalized patients (acute decompensated liver disease [ADLD], 292 patients; ACLF, 346 patients) from January 2019 to June 2020 were enrolled in this study. We compared the mortality rate at days 30 and 90 between patients with ADLD and ACLF. Areas under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curves of chronic liver failure–sequential organ failure assessment (CLIF-SOFA) and other existing scoring systems were compared among patients with ACLF. Results: The incidence of patients with ACLF was 54%. The main cause of chronic liver disease was alcohol (38%), with sepsis (50%) as the most common precipitating factor. ACLF with coagulopathy (AUROC 0.58, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.52–0.64), metabolic acidosis (AUROC 0.58, 95% CI: 0.52–0.64), and high aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (AUROC 0.59, 95% CI: 0.53–0.66) were associated with high 30-day mortality. The 30-day mortality rate of patients with acute decompensation and patients with ACLF was 46 and 58%, respectively. Respiratory system (P = 0.001) failure was the major end result in ACLF and constituted a significant factor to predict mortality. The AUROC of CLIF-SOFA score was superior to that of the other predicted score (AUROC 0.64, 95% CI: 0.585–0.704). Conclusion: Patients with ACLF with more organ failure and high CLIF-SOFA score were associated with high short-term mortality. Future studies should include an ACLF prospective registry to confirm these finding.']"

Savannakhet, one of the country’s top three most-visited provinces, was the focus of this study. Despite its record of good tourism growth over the last few decades, this province was chosen by only a small percentage of travelers as their final destination with overnight stops. The present study investigated tourism growth in Savannakhet, major factors influencing tourism growth, and tourist motivation to visit this province. The mixed-method approach was used to elicit quantitative and qualitative data which were collected through in-depth interviews, focus group discussions, and questionnaires. The results show that Savannakhet is ideally located in the center of the Mekong sub-region. With overland transport corridors and the Second Thai-Lao Friendship Bridge, Savannakhet has benefited from the growth of trade, investments, and tourism. The major motivations for tourists to travel to Savannakhet are its location, a culture similar culture to that of its neighbors, relaxation, and a gateway. However, most tourist locations in Savannakhet, according to SWOT analysis, still lack dominant attractiveness, sufficient tourism packages, tour operators, and supportive public transportation.

Additionally, sperm viability, acrosome integrity, mitochondrial activity, and plasma membrane integrity were evaluated after 4 (day 0), 72 (day 3), 120 (day 5), and 168 (day 7) h of storage using SYBR-14–ethidium homodimer-1 (EthD-1), EthD-1, JC-1, and the short hypo-osmotic swelling test, respectively. The analyses were carried out by using the general linear mixed model (MIXED) procedure of SAS. The statistical models for each data set included group, day after storage, and interaction between group and day after storage. The boar was included as a random effect. On day 0 after storage, progressive motility, VCL, VSL, VAP, and plasma membrane integrity of boar sperm in 0.3% of butaphosphan and cyanocobalamin supplementation were greater than those in the 0.4 and 0.5% groups (P < 0.05). On day 3 after storage, total motility and progressive motility, VCL, VSL, VAP, LIN, WOB, BCF, and plasma membrane integrity in 0.3% of butaphosphan and cyanocobalamin supplementation were significantly greater than those in the control group (P < 0.05). The total motility and progressive motility, VAP, and WOB in 0.3% of butaphosphan and cyanocobalamin supplementation were greater than those in the control group on day 5 after storage (P < 0.05). No effects of butaphosphan and cyanocobalamin supplementation on acrosome integrity and mitochondria activity were found on days 3, 5, and 7 after storage. However, the motility and progressive motility and the values for all sperm kinetic parameters except ALH in 0.3% of butaphosphan and cyanocobalamin supplementation were greater than those in the control group on day 7 after storage (P < 0.05). In conclusion, 0.3% of butaphosphan and cyanocobalamin supplementation in semen extender improved sperm motility, sperm activity, morphology, and life span in chilled boar sperm.', 'Zinc supplementation improves semen quality in boars  2021 Chulalongkorn University Printing House. All rights reserved.One of the causes of infertility in boars is nutritional deficiency. Interestingly, zinc has been used for improving semen quality in boars. Thus, the objective of this study was to investigate the effect of zinc as feed supplementation in order to improve semen quality in infertile boars. Three purebred Pietrain boars with a poor semen quality history were selected for the experiment. The semen samples were collected once a week for 4 weeks before the treatment period and the semen evaluated immediately. Fifteen grams (a total concentration of 150 ppm) of zinc were supplemented daily in the normal feed. The testing period was 16 consecutive weeks. The semen samples were evaluated for volume, concentration, motility (by computer-assisted sperm assay), sperm viability (by SYBR-green staining), acrosome integrity (by FITC-PNA staining), mitochondrial activity (by JC-1 staining) and sperm morphology (by Giemsa’s staining for sperm head and formal saline fixation for sperm tail). The semen samples were also preserved in commercial semen extender and stored at 16 °C for three days after ejaculation. The results showed that zinc supplementation significantly improved acrosome integrity (40.38 ± 7.13% and 70.56 ± 21.36%, respectively) and sperm viability (66.38 ± 5.46% and 79.66 ± 4.11%, respectively) at the ejaculation date and also significantly enhanced acrosome integrity after three days preservation (27.84 ± 7.78% and 67.36 ± 22.43%, respectively). In addition, we also found an increasing trend in acrosome integrity, sperm viability and progressive motility after 4 to 8 weeks of zinc supplementation. This study revealed that daily zinc addition can improve semen quality in infertile boars and can be used on farms to improve semen quality.']"

This study aimed to (1) gather the available published pharmacokinetic studies conducted in septic patients receiving CRRT and (2) to define the optimal meropenem dosing regimens in these populations via Monte Carlo simulations. Methods: We used Medical Subject Headings ""meropenem,""""continuous renal replacement therapy,""and ""pharmacokinetics""or related terms to identify studies for systematic review. A one-compartment pharmacokinetic model was conducted to predict meropenem levels for the initial 48 h of therapy. The PD targets were 40% of free drug above a threshold of 1 times the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) (40% fT > MIC), 4 times the MIC (40% fT > 4MIC), and an additional target of free drug level above 1 times MIC 100% of the time (fT > MIC). The dose that achieved at least 90% of the probability of target attainment (PTA) was defined as an optimal dose. Results: Twenty-one articles were included for our systematic review. The necessary pharmacokinetic parameters such as volume of distribution and CRRT clearance were cited in 90.5 and 71.4% of articles, respectively. None of the published studies reported completed necessary parameters. A regimen of 750 mg q 8 h was found to be the optimal dose for pre-dilution continuous venovenous hemofiltration and continuous venovenous hemodialysis modality using two effluent rates (25 and 35 mL/kg/h) which achieved the PD target of 40% fT > 4MIC. Conclusion: None of the published studies showed the necessary pharmacokinetic parameters. PD target significantly contributed to meropenem dosage regimens in these patients. Differing effluent rates and types of CRRT shared similar dosing regimens. Clinical validation of the recommendation is suggested.']"

All rights reserved.Background: Indoor air pollution contains several substances and can emanate from a range of sources. Of particular importance are volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and respirable particulates. The exposure to indoor air pollution can induce a wide range of acute and chronic respiratory health effects. Objective: To investigate respiratory health effects of occupants in air-conditioned offices and to determine factors influencing their respiratory health. Materials and Methods: Fourteen air-conditioned offices in Bangkok were measured for volume and concentration of PM2.5 and VOC. The 212 occupants in these offices were surveyed and their lung function were tested. The subjective respiratory symptoms were cough, phlegm, wheezing, and short breathing. Results: The logistic regression analysis showed the concentration of VOC was significantly associated with forced vital capacity (FVC) and wheeze symptoms (p<0.05). Concentration of PM2.5 was significantly associated with the forced expiratory volume in the first second (FEV1) over the FVC (p<0.05). Smoking was significantly associated with cough (p<0.05). The significant association between history in gas or VOC job, and phlegm, current work experience, and FEV1 over the FVC ratio were found. Conclusion: Indoor air pollution exposure was associated with respiratory health effects. Smoking and work experience also affect the respiratory health.', 'Modern Solutions for Indoor Air Quality Management in Commercial and Residential Spaces  2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.Indoor air pollutants in certain environments, such as a damp home or a low-ventilation office, are more concentrated indoors than outdoors. As people spend most of their time indoors, there is a high chance that they are exposed to indoor air pollution. This exposure might lead to adverse health outcomes such as allergies, infection, and respiratory diseases. Therefore, proper indoor environment management is crucial for promoting indoor air quality, consequently benefiting the health and well-being of occupants. In commercial spaces, a lot of people gather and perform various activities together, and higher concentrations of indoor air pollution are generated, which leads to accumulation of pollutants if proper management is not achieved, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic when biological pollutants (i.e., viral particle) can accumulate indoors due to poor ventilation environment. In residential spaces, indoor air quality may worsen due to activities such as cooking, painting, using personal care products, and washing. These activities generate indoor air pollution, thus affecting the health of occupants. In addition, poor air quality in microenvironments apparently affects sleep quality. This chapter proposes a concept of indoor air quality management in commercial and residential spaces including sources and control. Moreover, the management technologies have been summarized varying from a simple technique that can be handled by the occupants to a more complicated technique that requires more equipment and professional skill. The methods provided here can benefit the occupants, especially the occupants living in limited-space residences, such as apartment buildings in urban areas.', ""Long-Term Associations between Greenness and Air Pollution with Risk Factors for Cardiovascular Disease: A Cohort Study  2023, Avestia Publishing. All rights reserved.Epidemiological studies show that both increasing air pollution and less exposure to greenness may lead to the development of cardiovascular disease (CVD) [1, 2]. However, limited longitudinal studies identified the associations between residential greenness and CVD risk factors, such as blood pressure (BP) [3], blood lipids [4] and blood sugar [5]. We examined the associations between long-term exposure to greenness and air pollution with BP (i.e., systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP)), blood lipids (i.e., total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), and triglycerides (TG)) and fasting glucose (FG) using workers cohort study from Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand (EGAT) in Bangkok metropolitan region (BMR), Thailand. This study was based on 2,027 participants from the EGAT1 cohort study (2002-2017; aged 52-71 years at the baseline) [6]. Outcome variables were measured in 2002, 2007, 2012, and 2017. The amount of greenness in each participant's subdistrict was measured using the satellite-derived Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). The average concentration of each air pollutant (i.e., particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter ≤10 μm (PM10), ozone (O3), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), sulfur dioxide (SO2), and carbon monoxide (CO)) at the sub-district level in BMR from 2002 to 2017 was generated using the kriging method [7]. Exposure periods were averaged to 1 year prior to each participant’s follow-up date. We applied linear mixed effects models to analyze the association of greenness and air pollution with outcome variables. Each participant was assigned as a random intercept in our models to control the autocorrelation of repeated measurements for the same participant. Outcome variables (SBP, DBP, TC, LDL-C, HDL-C, TG, and FG) were transformed using a log10 function to improve normality and stabilize variances. During the follow-up period, participants' average exposure to PM10 was 46.6 µg/m3, which nearly exceeded Thailand's annual PM10 standard (50 µg/m3). After adjusting for potential confounders (e.g., age, sex, body mass index, smoking status, alcohol consumption, education level, income, and prevalence and treatment of hypertension, diabetes, and hypercholesterolemia), an interquartile range increment of PM10, O3, SO2, and CO was associated with elevated TC [2.4% (95% Confidence Interval (CI): 1.6, 3.3), 1.5% (0.9, 2.0), 2.6% (1.3, 3.9), and 2.4% (1.6, 3.2), respectively] and LDL-C [2.0% (0.8, 3.3), 1.5% (0.6, 2.3), 3.1% (1.2, 5.1), and 2.6% (1.4, 3.8), respectively]. PM10, O3, and CO were negatively associated with HDL-C [-2.0% (-2.8, -1.2), -0.8% (-1.3, -0.2), and -1.7 (-2.6, -0.8), respectively]. Elevated FG levels were also inversely associated with higher PM10 [1.9% (1.2, 2.6)], SO2 [2.7% (1.6, 3.8)], and CO [1.9% (1.2, 2.5)]. Moreover, we also observed the positive associations between PM10 and SO2 with SBP and DBP. In two-pollutant models, associations between all air pollutants and outcome variables were not essentially changed. However, we were unable to find a clear association between NDVI and EVI for all outcome variables. These findings suggest that exposure to air pollution may increase the risk of CVD. In areas with high levels of air pollution, green spaces might not have a beneficial effect on health outcomes.""]"

Effective targeted therapy and accurate prognostic biomarkers are still lacking. Ferroptosis is a form of regulated cell death implicated in cancer progression and has emerged as a potential therapeutic target in various cancers. However, a comprehensive analysis of ferroptosis-related genes (FRGs) for predicting CCA prognosis and therapeutic targets and determining the role of ferroptosis in CCA remain to be performed. Here, we developed a prognostic FRG signature using a least absolute shrinkage and selection operator Cox regression analysis in a training cohort. We then validated it using four independent public datasets. The six-FRG signature was developed to predict CCA patient survival, stratifying them into low-risk and high-risk groups based on survival time. Significantly, the high-risk CCA patients had shorter overall survival. A receiver operating characteristic curve analysis further confirmed the prognostic FRG signature’s strong predictive ability, indicating that it was an independent prognostic indicator for CCA patients. Furthermore, the high-risk group was associated with fluke infection and high clinical stages. Cancer-associated fibroblast (CAF) score and CAF markers were significantly higher in the high-risk group than the low-risk group. Moreover, our FRG signature could predict immune checkpoint markers for immunotherapy and drug sensitivity. The mRNA expression levels of the six-FRG signature was validated in 10 CCA cell lines and dividing them into low-risk and high-risk groups using the FRG signature. We further showed that high-risk CCA cell lines were more resistant to ferroptosis inducers, including erastin and RSL3, than the low-risk CCA cell lines. Our study constructed a novel FRG signature model to predict CCA prognoses which might provide prognostic biomarkers and potential therapeutic targets for CCA patients. Ferroptosis sensitivity in high-risk and low-risk CCA cell lines suggests that ferroptosis resistance is associated with high-risk group CCA. Therefore, ferroptosis could be a promising therapeutic target for precision therapy in CCA patients.', 'Clinical epidemiology of cholangiocarcinoma  Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2021. All rights reserved.Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) is a relatively rare cancer but is becoming increasingly important due to its rising incidence globally. The incidence of CCA substantially varies by geographic area, with high disease burden in East Asian countries and relatively low incidence in Western countries. Conditions strongly contributing to the risk of CCA include choledochal cyst, hepatolithiasis, primary sclerosing cholangitis, and liver fluke infection. Recent epidemiologic data have shown that chronic liver diseases (cirrhosis, chronic viral hepatitis B/C infection, and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease) and metabolic conditions (diabetes, metabolic syndrome) may also increase the risk of CCA development. Occupational exposure to certain toxins and chemicals is also significantly associated with CCA risk. Surveillance of CCA in specific groups of patients has been shown to improve survival. A role for aspirin in the prevention of CCA has also been suggested. The present chapter will review these and other epidemiological aspects of CCA.', 'Key necroptotic proteins are required for Smac mimetic-mediated sensitization of cholangiocarcinoma cells to TNF-α and chemotherapeutic gemcitabine-induced necroptosis  2020 Public Library of Science. All rights reserved.Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA), a malignant tumor originating in the biliary tract, is well known to be associated with adverse clinical outcomes and high mortality rates due to the lack of effective therapy. Evasion of apoptosis is considered a key contributor to therapeutic success and chemotherapy resistance in CCA, highlighting the need for novel therapeutic strategies. In this study, we demonstrated that the induction of necroptosis, a novel regulated form of necrosis, could potentially serve as a novel therapeutic approach for CCA patients. The RNA sequencing data in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database were analyzed and revealed that both receptor-interacting protein kinase 3 (RIPK3) and mixed lineage kinase domain-like (MLKL), two essential mediators of necroptosis, were upregulated in CCA tissues when compared with the levels in normal bile ducts. We demonstrated in a panel of CCA cell lines that RIPK3 was differentially expressed in CCA cell lines, while MLKL was more highly expressed in CCA cell lines than in nontumor cholangiocytes. We therefore showed that treatment with both tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and Smac mimetic, an inhibitor of apoptosis protein (IAP) antagonist, induced RIPK1/RIPK3/MLKLdependent necroptosis in CCA cells when caspases were blocked. The necroptotic induction in a panel of CCA cells was correlated with RIPK3 expression. Intriguingly, we demonstrated that Smac mimetic sensitized CCA cells to a low dose of standard chemotherapy, gemcitabine, and induced necroptosis in an RIPK1/RIPK3/MLKL-dependent manner upon caspase inhibition but not in nontumor cholangiocytes. We further demonstrated that Smac mimetic and gemcitabine synergistically induced an increase in TNF-α mRNA levels and that Smac mimetic reversed gemcitabine-induced cell cycle arrest, leading to cell killing. Collectively, our present study demonstrated that TNF-α and gemcitabine induced RIPK1/ RIPK3/MLKL-dependent necroptosis upon IAP depletion and caspase inhibition; therefore, our findings have pivotal implications for designing a novel necroptosis-based therapeutic strategy for CCA patients.']"

We performed a pooled analysis of virologically suppressed Asian participants from three international phase III trials to evaluate the efficacy and safety of switching to B/F/TAF. Methods: Virologically suppressed people living with HIV were randomized to switch to B/F/TAF or to stay on baseline regimens. The primary endpoint was the proportion of participants with plasma HIV-1 RNA ≥50 copies/ml at week 48. We analysed the incidence of adverse events (AEs), laboratory abnormalities, and changes in relevant tolerability parameters through 48 weeks. Results: Overall, 136 Asian participants were included. The proportions of participants with plasma HIV-1 RNA ≥50 copies/ml at week 48 were low in both arms (0% for B/F/TAF vs 1.4% for those who stayed on baseline regimens). Those who switched to B/F/TAF had virological suppression rates similar to those who stayed on baseline regimens (100% vs 95.9%, p = 0.2485), with no treatment-emergent resistance. Drug-related AEs occurred in three participants in each arm; none were serious. No participants discontinued the study drug because of AEs, and no deaths were observed. No significant differences were observed between the arms in the median changes in estimated glomerular filtration rate, body weight, and most lipid parameters.

Rilpivirine (RPV, TMC278) is formulated in a low-cost STR with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) and emtricitabine (FTC). Objectives: Switching at Low HIV-1 RNA into Fixed Dose Combinations (SALIF) compared RPV with efavirenz (EFV), both as STRs with TDF and FTC, in maintaining virologic suppression. Methods: SALIF was a phase 3b, randomised, open-label, non-inferiority study in virologically suppressed adults (HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL) on non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI)-based first-line antiretroviral therapy (ART) in Cameroon, Kenya, Senegal, South Africa, Uganda and Thailand. Patients (N = 426), stratified by NNRTI use, were randomised 1:1 to receive TDF/FTC/RPV (300/200/25 mg qd) or TDF/FTC/EFV (300/200/600 mg qd).

We investigated the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of switching to a TAF-based, single-tablet regimen containing elvitegravir, cobicistat, FTC, and tenofovir alafenamide (E/C/F/TAF) versus remaining on ATV + RTV plus FTC/TDF. Methods: After completing the initial randomized, blinded phase, virologically suppressed (HIV-1 RNA <50 copies/mL) women on ATV + RTV plus FTC/TDF were rerandomized (3:1) to receive open-label E/C/F/TAF versus remaining on their current regimen. The primary end point was proportion of participants with plasma HIV-1 RNA <50 copies per milliliter at week 48 (U.S. FDA snapshot algorithm), with a prespecified noninferiority margin of 12%. Safety [adverse events (AEs)] and tolerability were also assessed. Results: Of 575 women originally randomized and treated in the blinded phase, 159 were rerandomized to switch to E/C/F/TAF and 53 to remain on ATV + RTV plus FTC/TDF. At week 48, virologic suppression was maintained in 150 (94%) of women on E/C/F/TAF and 46 (87%) on ATV + RTV plus FTC/TDF [difference 7.5% (95% confidence interval -1.2% to 19.4%)], demonstrating noninferiority of E/C/F/TAF to ATV + RTV and FTC/TDF. Incidence of AEs was similar between groups; study drug–related AEs were more common with E/C/F/TAF (11% versus 4%). Conclusions: Switching to E/C/F/TAF was noninferior to continuing ATV + RTV plus FTC/TDF in maintaining virologic suppression and was well tolerated at 48 weeks.']"

Efficient operation of the VRFB to maximize the system efficiency and realize safe operation is necessary. In this work, an optimal operational strategy for improving the system efficiency is proposed. The optimization problem by minimizing the charging energy and maximizing the discharge energy under operational constraints during VRFB operation is formulated. In the proposed strategy, the electrolyte flow rate is determined and adjusted according to the variation in the active vanadium species during the charge–discharge process to ensure high system efficiency. Because operation of the VRFB under an electrolyte imbalance is considered, this new control strategy can extend the operating window in which VRFBs can operate with high discharge capacity and system efficiency.', 'Improving the Performance of an All-Vanadium Redox Flow Battery under Imbalance Conditions: Online Dynamic Optimization Approach Copyright  2020 American Chemical Society.During the operation of an all-vanadium redox flow battery (VRFB), the electrolyte flow of vanadium is a crucial operating parameter, affecting both the system performance and operational costs. Thus, this study aims to develop an on-line optimal operational strategy of the VRFB. A dynamic model of the VRFB based on the mass transport equation coupled with electrochemical kinetics and a vanadium ionic diffusion is adopted to determine the optimal flow rate of the vanadium electrolyte by solving an on-line dynamic optimization problem, taking into account the battery capacity degradation due to electrolyte imbalance. Based on the measurement of modified open-circuit voltage, the extended Kalman filter (EKF) is implemented to estimate a change in the concentration of vanadium, which is used to on-line update the optimal vanadium flow rate. The results show that the on-line optimization of the vanadium flow rate incorporated with the EKF estimator can enhance the system efficiency (7.4% increase in state of charge) when the VRFB is operated under the intermittent current density. Also, it can prevent the battery voltage from reaching the limiting voltage before the battery achieves the desired state of charge.', 'Effect of battery material and operation on dynamic performance of a vanadium redox flow battery under electrolyte imbalance conditions  2023 Elsevier LtdAn electrolyte imbalance in a vanadium redox flow battery (VRFB) is a significant problem that can degrade the performance of VRFB during a long-term operation. The systematic analysis of a VRFB is, therefore, performed to examine the battery performance and capacity degradation caused by an electrolyte imbalance through the use of different electrode materials and membranes, which consider carbon felt structures and their treatment, and cation- and anion-exchange types of membrane. A dynamic model of the VRFB explains the gas evolutions and self-discharge side reactions coupled with the mass balance of the vanadium and proton ions. Investigation of the VRFB performance reveals that the rate of capacity loss resulting from the electrolyte imbalance considerably depends on the material and operating conditions. The variation of the vanadium ions during long-term operation depends on the gassing and self-discharge side reactions. The VRFB using Type 3 electrodes and an AMV membrane provides the highest energy efficiency. The battery operating time is considered a key factor in managing the vanadium variation caused by self-discharge reactions. Current density, temperature, and total vanadium concentration are found to affect the battery capacity degradation rate. A high-capacity degradation rate is observed under low current density, high temperature, and high total vanadium concentration conditions. However, changes in the electrolyte flow rate do not improve the battery capacity during long-term operation because the state of charge of the VRFB decreases due to the electrolyte imbalance.']"

However, using the actual ratings from neighbors to predict ratings of target user toward target item often leads to low accuracy prediction due to the improper rating range problem. Rating conversion methods are proposed to solve this problem over the past few years. To propose rating conversion method, each user’s preference or rating pattern is needed. Some studies adopt the idea from translation-based embedding model and represent user’s preference in graph form. Although some studies represent users, items, and relations in embedding vector form, their representation may be improper and inaccurate if the rating pattern of each user is not in the same range. These vectors still suffer from the improper rating range as well. In this work, we propose a translation-based embedding model with rating conversion in RSs. We aim to solve the improper rating range problem in translation-based embedding model. Our challenges are 1) representing the relation (rating) between a pair of user and item in vector form, instead of scalar form and 2) dealing with rating conversion of user’s rating in vector form. The FilmTrust and MovieLens dataset are used in experiments comparing the proposed method with the existing methods. The evaluation showed that the proposed rating conversion method provides better accuracy results in term of both rating prediction and ranking recommendation.', 'Attentive Hybrid Collaborative Filtering for Rating Conversion in Recommender Systems  2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.Recommendation models that use collaborative filtering consider the influence of friends and neighbors when recommending suitable items for a target user. Most of these neighborhood-based models use the actual ratings from neighbors to predict the ratings of the target user toward target items, which often leads to a low accuracy prediction caused by the improper rating-range problem. Recently, rating conversion methods have been proposed to address this issue. Because each friend/neighbor can have a different level of influence on the target user, we propose a friend module, which converts their ratings to match the target user’s perspective and assigns different weight to each user before modeling latent relations and predictions. In rating conversion, ratings that involve explicit feedback are important. Instead of the traditional approach to user embedding, we propose a novel approach that uses explicit feedback. This can express user features better than traditional methods and can then be used to convert ratings to match the target user’s perspective. For better representation and recommendation, we also learn latent relations between each user and item by adopting knowledge graph ideas, which leads to more accurate results. The FilmTrust and MovieLens datasets are used in experiments comparing the proposed method with existing methods. This evaluation showed that our model is more accurate than existing methods.', 'A Hotel Hybrid Recommendation Method based on Context-Driven using Latent Dirichlet Allocation  2019 IEEE.Recommendation systems play an important role in helping users find items that they want. Normally, ratings are used in content-based filtering (CBF) and collaborative filtering (CF) for recommendation. However, only ratings are not enough for recommendation. Thus, contextual information, context driven and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) are used to improve recommendation. Also, the context of individual user has changed in the timeline (context-driven). In this work, a hotel hybrid recommendation method (CF+CBF) based on context-driven using LDA is proposed. Firstly, we find missing user ratings of user-hotel rating matrix by applying LDA on user ratings in order to get predicted score of hotels for a target user. Secondly, we find a group of users similar to target users (neighbors). Then, we apply context-driven to recommend hotels that meet current interest of target user. To evaluate the proposed method, we compared our proposed methods to either CBF or CF integrating with LDA by measuring nDCG. The result shows that our proposed method outperforms in accurate result.']"

All rights reserved.ImportancePatients with nonmetastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) are primarily treated by radiotherapy with curative intent with or without chemotherapy and often experience substantial treatment-related toxic effects even with modern radiation techniques, such as intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT). Intensity-modulated proton therapy (IMPT) may improve the toxicity profile; however, there is a paucity of data given the limited availability of IMPT in regions with endemic NPC. ObjectiveTo compare toxic effects and oncologic outcomes among patients with newly diagnosed nonmetastatic NPC when treated with IMPT vs IMRT with or without chemotherapy. Design, Setting, and ParticipantsThis retrospective cohort study included 77 patients with newly diagnosed nonmetastatic NPC who received curative-intent radiotherapy with IMPT or IMRT at a tertiary academic cancer center from January 1, 2016, to December 31, 2019. Forty-eight patients with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-positive tumors were included in a 1:1 propensity score-matched analysis for survival outcomes. The end of the follow-up period was March 31, 2021. ExposuresIMPT vs IMRT with or without chemotherapy. Main Outcomes and MeasuresThe main outcomes were the incidence of acute and chronic treatment-related adverse events (AEs) and oncologic outcomes, including locoregional failure-free survival (LRFS), progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS). ResultsWe identified 77 patients (25 [32.5%] women; 52 [67.5%] men; median [interquartile range] age, 48.7 [42.2-60.3] years), among whom 28 (36.4%) were treated with IMPT and 49 (63.6%) were treated with IMRT. Median (interquartile range) follow-up was 30.3 (17.9-41.5) months. On multivariable logistic regression analyses, IMPT was associated with lower likelihood of developing grade 2 or higher acute AEs compared with IMRT (odds ratio [OR], 0.15; 95% CI, 0.03-0.60; P = .01). Only 1 case (3.8%) of a chronic grade 3 or higher AE occurred in the IMPT group compared with 8 cases (16.3%) in the IMRT group (OR, 0.21; 95% CI, 0.01-1.21; P = .15). Propensity score matching generated a balanced cohort of 48 patients (24 IMPT vs 24 IMRT) and found similar PFS in the IMPT and IMRT groups (2-year PFS, 95.7% [95% CI, 87.7%-100%] vs 76.7% [95% CI, 60.7%-97.0%]; hazard ratio [HR], 0.31; 95% CI, 0.07-1.47; P = .14). No locoregional recurrence or death was observed in the IMPT group from the matched cohort. Two-year LRFS was 100% (95% CI, 100%-100%) in the IMPT group and 86.2% (95% CI, 72.8%-100%) in the IMRT group (P = .08). Three-year OS was 100% (95% CI, 100%-100%) in the IMPT group and 94.1% (95% CI, 83.6%-100%) in the IMRT group (P = .42). Smoking history was the only clinical factor significantly associated with both poor LRFS (HR, 63.37; 95% CI, 3.25-1236.13; P = .006) and poor PFS (HR, 6.33; 95% CI, 1.16-34.57; P = .03) on multivariable analyses. Conclusions and RelevanceIn this study, curative-intent radiotherapy with IMPT for nonmetastatic NPC was associated with significantly reduced acute toxicity burden in comparison with IMRT, with rare late complications and excellent oncologic outcomes, including 100% locoregional control at 2 years.

However, the prognostic value of the EBV concentration during radiation therapy (mid-EBV) has not been vigorously studied. This was a post hoc analysis of 105 detectable pre-EBV NPC patients from a phase II/III study comparing sequential (SEQ) versus simultaneous integrated boost (SIB) intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT). Plasma EBV DNA concentrations were measured by PCR before commencement of IMRT, at the 5th week of radiation therapy and 3 months after the completion of IMRT. The objective was to identify the prognostic value of mid-EBV to predict overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS) and distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS). A median pre-EBV was 6880 copies/ml. Mid-EBV and post-EBV were detectable in 14.3% and 6.7% of the patients, respectively. The median follow-up time was 45.3 months. The 3-year OS, PFS and DMFS rates were 86.0% vs. 66.7% (p = 0.043), 81.5% vs. 52.5% (p = 0.006), 86.1% vs. 76.6% (p = 0.150), respectively, for those with undetectable mid-EBV vs. persistently detectable mid-EBV. However, in the multivariate analysis, only persistently detectable post-EBV was significantly associated with a worse OS (hazard ratio (HR) = 6.881, 95% confident interval (CI) 1.699-27.867, p = 0.007), PFS (HR = 5.117, 95% CI 1.562-16.768, p = 0.007) and DMFS (HR = 129.071, 95%CI 19.031-875.364, p < 0.001).

Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved.Objective: Plasma Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) DNA concentration at the time of diagnosis (pre-EBV) can be used to stratify risk for nasopharyngeal cancer (NPC) patients. However, pre-EBV cut-off values vary among studies. Methods: This was a post hoc analysis of 208 NPC patients from a phase II/III study comparing sequential (SEQ) vs. simultaneous integrated boost (SIB) intensity modulated radiation therapy. The objective was to identify the optimal pre-EBV cut-off value to predict overall survival (OS), progression free survival (PFS) and distant metastatic free survival (DMFS) rates. Results: The pre-EBV and post-treatment EBV DNA (post-EBV) were detectable in 59.1% and 3.8% of the patients, respectively. A new pre-EBV cut-off value of 2300 copies/ml was identified by the receiver operating characteristics analysis. This cut-off value showed 82% sensitivity, 59% specificity and 31.7% positive and 93.5% negative predictive values in predicting OS. The 3-year OS, PFS and DMFS were 95.6 vs. 73.8%, 89.8 vs. 55.3% and 93 vs. 70.1% for pre-EBV < vs. ≥ 2300 copies/ml, respectively. Older age group (≥ 45 years), high pre-EBV and detectable post-EBV concentration were independent predictors for OS, PFS and DMFS in a multivariate analysis. When the stage grouping and pre-EBV value were combined, a subgroup of patients with stage II-III and pre-EBV values < 2300 copies/ml. had the best survival outcomes, while the worst survival subgroup was the patients with stage III-IVb with pre-EBV values ≥ 2300 copies/ml. Conclusions: Pre-EBV cut-off of 2300 copies/ml is an optimal value predicting OS, PFS and DMFS.']"

The GC × GC system employed a long1D (30 m) and a short2D (5 m) column with a flow modulator and a Deans switch (DS) as a splitter; meanwhile. The H/C system was applied solely as a DS located between long1D (30 m) and2D (60 m) columns without use of cryogenic trapping devices.

Various 2D1 and 2D2 columns may be selected to provide complementary selectivity (polarity) compared to the 1D column. The tunable residence time arising from differential pressure drop in each 2D column results in a tunable fractional contribution of each column in the 2D separation. A sample mixture comprising different chemical classes, including alkanes and alcohols, is used to identify the feasibility and extent of selectivity tuning possible in GC×PTGC. The column length is also varied due to the imposed challenge of wraparound in the PT coupled column system as pressures are adjusted in the 2D separation.

In this study, the analytical solutions of time summation model combined with temperature dependent linear solvation energy relationship (LSER) were derived for constant flow separation in GC × GC. The derived equations allow calculation of analyte retention time in first and second dimensional separation (1tR and 2tR), under temperature program separation employing any column combination with known LSER database. As a result, optimization software was developed enabling simulation of several hundred thousand GC × GC results (fingerprints) for separation of each sample. Good correlations between our predicted results and the results obtained with the previously established numerical approach, were obtained with the R2 of 1.000 and 0.998 for simulation of 1tR and 2tR, respectively. The developed approaches were further applied to simulation of 96,000 individual fingerprints in temperature programmed GC × GC, with the focus on application of 16 column sets including non-ionic liquid and ionic liquid (IL) stationary phases for separation of 678 model compounds. These approaches resulted in the computational time of 1 day compared with 1 year provided by the numerical method. Best column sets and experimental conditions (secondary column lengths and temperature programs) could then be extracted according to maximizing number of separated peaks in separation, which represents the quality of each fingerprinting.']"

Based on vaccination protocol, 24 pigs were equally divided into three groups: T1 was vaccinated at 15 and 19 weeks of age, T2 received vaccine at 9 and 19 weeks of age and C remained intact. P450arom and AMH expressions were analysed using immunohistochemistry and Western blot. The results revealed that testicular length was highest in C pigs, but not different between T1 and T2 groups (6.5 ± 0.2 versus 6.9 ± 0.3 cm, p =.538). Histomorphometry demonstrated that the height of spermatogenic epithelia, the diameter of seminiferous tubules and the number of seminiferous tubules between T1 and T2 groups were not different (p >.05). For P450arom, immunohistochemistry revealed that H-score of C group was significantly higher than that of both T1 and T2 groups. Western blot analysis showed that C group possessed the densest protein band. Moreover, H-score between T1 and T2 groups was not significantly different. Protein band intensity between both groups was not apparently different. As for AMH, C pigs had significantly lower H-score than both T1 and T2 pigs. Furthermore, T2 pigs possessed significantly higher H-score than T1 pigs. Western blot analysis showed that the most intense protein band was found in T2 group.

All rights reserved.In female pigs, the anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) produced by granulosa cells of developing follicles plays an important role in ovarian reserves of follicles and serum AMH levels are the biological marker of gilt reproductive performance. In the present study, we determined the AMH expression during follicular growth in replacement gilts culled due to anestrus by immunohistochemical technique. A total of 20 reproductive organs from crossbred Landrace Yorkshire gilts were collected from swine commercial farms in Thailand and categorized by the reasons for culling, i.e., the anestrus group (n=12) and other causes not related to reproduction as the control group (n=8). As expected, the AMH immunolocalization in control gilts was markedly observed in most granulosa cells of healthy preantral, early antral, large antral and preovulatory follicles. The AMH immunostaining in the granulosa cells of most presumably healthy follicles in anestrus gilts depicted weak immunoreaction and the intensity score was significantly lower (P<0.05) than the control gilts. Certainly, the granulosa cells within the atretic follicles in both the control and anestrus groups were faint from AMH immunoreaction. The findings indicate that the low intensity of AMH immunoexpression found in the granulosa cells might be associated with a decreasing of serum AMH level in anestrus gilts.

The present study aimed to investigate the gene expression profiles of AMH, AR and INHA in undescended testes (UDT) and descended testes (DT) in unilateral cryptorchid pigs of suckling (1-2 weeks of age), nursery (6 weeks of age) and growing-finishing pigs (15-20 weeks of age) and in normal testes (NT) at 1-2 weeks of age, using quantitative real-time reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR). A significant decrease in expression of AMH and AR genes in the UDT group was observed compared with the DT group at 15-20 weeks. Within each group, the highest expression of AMH was observed at 6 weeks of age, whereas the lowest expression was shown at 15-20 weeks compared with other ages.

Prominent expression of AR and INHA was observed in the DT group at 20 weeks. In conclusion, this study unveiled the decreased expression of AMH and AR genes in UDT compared with DT in growing-finishing pigs. Markedly increased expression of AR and INHA was observed in DT when pigs reached puberty.']"

Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), overexpressed in many types of cancer, has been proved as a high potential target for targeted cancer therapy due to its role in regulating proliferation and survival of cancer cells. In the present study, a series of designed vinyl sulfone derivatives was screened against EGFR tyrosine kinase (EGFR-TK) using in silico and in vitro studies. The molecular docking results suggested that, among 78 vinyl sulfones, there were eight compounds that could interact well with the EGFR-TK at the ATP-binding site. Afterwards, these screened compounds were tested for the inhibitory activity towards EGFR-TK using ADP-Glo™ kinase assay, and we found that only VF16 compound exhibited promising inhibitory activity against EGFR-TK with the IC50 value of 7.85 ± 0.88 nM. In addition, VF16 showed a high cytotoxicity with IC50 values of 33.52 ± 2.57, 54.63 ± 0.09, and 30.38 ± 1.37 µM against the A431, A549, and H1975 cancer cell lines, respectively. From 500-ns MD simulation, the structural stability of VF16 in complex with EGFR-TK was quite stable, suggesting that this compound could be a novel small molecule inhibitor targeting EGFR-TK.', 'Sulfonylated Indeno[1,2-c]quinoline Derivatives as Potent EGFR Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors  2023 The Authors. Published by American Chemical Society.The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) has been considered a potential target for lung cancer therapy due to its essential role in regulating the survival and proliferation of cancer cells. Although erlotinib, a potent EGFR tyrosine kinase (EGFR-TK) inhibitor, has been used as the first-line drug for lung cancer treatment, acquired drug resistance caused by the T790M secondary mutation of EGFR-TK inevitably develops after a median response duration of 9-13 months. Thus, the search for promising compounds to effectively target EGFR-TK has become an imperative necessity. In this study, the kinase inhibitory activities of a series of sulfonylated indeno[1,2-c]quinolines (SIQs) against EGFR-TK were experimentally and theoretically investigated. Among the 23 SIQ derivatives studied, eight compounds showed enhanced EGFR-TK inhibitory activity (IC50 values of ca. 0.6-10.2 nM) compared to the known drug erlotinib (IC50 of ∼20 nM). In a cell-based assay in human cancer cell lines with EGFR overexpression (A549 and A431 cells), the eight selected SIQs all showed more significant cytotoxicity against A431 than A549 cells, consistent with the higher EGFR expression in A431 cells. Molecular docking and FMO-RIMP2/PCM calculations revealed that SIQ17 occupies the ATP-binding site of EGFR-TK, where its sulfonyl group is mainly stabilized by C797, L718, and E762 residues. Triplicate 500 ns molecular dynamics (MD) simulations also confirmed the binding strength of SIQ17 in complex with EGFR. Overall, the potent SIQ compounds obtained in this work could be further optimized for developing novel anticancer drug candidates targeting EGFR-TK.', 'Biological evaluation and molecular dynamics simulation of chalcone derivatives as epidermal growth factor-tyrosine kinase inhibitors  2019 by the authors.Targeted cancer therapy has become a high potential cancer treatment. Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), which plays an important role in cell signaling, enhanced cell survival and proliferation, has been suggested as molecular target for the development of novel cancer therapeutics. In this study, a series of chalcone derivatives was screened by in vitro cytotoxicity against the wild type (A431 and A549) and mutant EGFR (H1975 and H1650) cancer cell lines, and, subsequently, tested for EGFR-tyrosine kinase (TK) inhibition. From the experimental screening, all chalcones seemed to be more active against the A431 than the A549 cell line, with chalcones 1c, 2a, 3e, 4e, and 4t showing a more than 50% inhibitory activity against the EGFR-TK activity and a high cytotoxicity with IC50 values of < 10 µM against A431 cells. Moreover, these five chalcones showed more potent on H1975 (T790M/L858R mutation) than H1650 (exon 19 deletion E746-A750) cell lines. Only three chalcones (1c, 2a and 3e) had an inhibitory activity against EGFR-TK with a relative inhibition percentage that was close to the approved drug, erlotinib. Molecular dynamics studies on their complexes with EGFR-TK domain in aqueous solution affirmed that they were well-occupied within the ATP binding site and strongly interacted with seven hydrophobic residues, including the important hinge region residue M793. From the above information, as well as ADMET (absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity) properties, all three chalcones could serve as lead compounds for the development of EGFR-TK inhibitors.']"

A total of 523 swab samples (nasal, oral, and rectal swabs) and 159 serum samples from dogs (n = 83) and cats (n = 93) were collected and tested for SARS-CoV-2 RNA and antibodies. All swab samples tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 RNA by real-time RT-PCR with three panels of specific primers and probes. Although all dogs and cats were negative for SARS-CoV-2 RNA, 3.14% (5/159) had anti-N-IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 by indirect multispecies ELISA. Our results demonstrated SARS-CoV-2 exposure in domestic animals living in high-risk areas during the second wave of the COVID-19 outbreak in Thailand. Thus, the use of one health approach for monitoring SARS-CoV-2 in domestic animals in high-risk areas of COVID-19 outbreaks should be routinely conducted and will provide benefits to risk communications in communities.', 'SARS-CoV-2 Transmission from Human to Pet and Suspected Transmission from Pet to Human, Thailand  2022 Piewbang et al. This is an open-access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license.Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has been the cause of human pandemic infection since late 2019. SARS-CoV-2 infection in animals has also been reported both naturally and experimentally, rendering awareness about a potential source of infection for one health concern. Here, we describe an epidemiological investigation of SARS-CoV-2 infection in 639 cats and 224 dogs throughout multiple waves of COVID-19 outbreaks in Thailand. To indicate the potential source of infection, we performed SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequencing of samples obtained from pets and contacted humans, combined with in-depth interviews to support the epidemiological investigation. In the tested animals, SARS-CoV-2 RNA was present in 23 cases (19 cats and 4 dogs). Whole-genome sequencing of selected samples showed various SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern, which included the original European lineage (B.1), Alpha (B.1.1.7), Delta (B.1.617), and Omicron (BA.2). Among SARS-CoV-2-positive pets, 34.78% had evidence of contact with infected humans. Together with genomic analysis and an overlapping timeline, we revealed evidence of viral transmission from infected humans as the primary source, which spread to household cats via an undefined mode of transmission and most likely circulated between cohoused cats and caretakers within the weeks before the investigation. The SARS-CoV-2 surface glycoprotein (spike gene) obtained from caretakers of individual cats contained sequence signatures found in the sequences of infected cats, indicating possible exposure to the virus excreted by cats. Although pet-to-human transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is considered relatively rare, our study provides suspected episodes of human infection from animals that were initially infected through contact with infected humans.', 'First cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection in dogs and cats in Thailand  2021 Wiley-VCH GmbH.Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic in humans since late 2019. Here, we investigated SARS-CoV-2 infection in dogs and cats during COVID-19 quarantine at private veterinary hospitals in Thailand. From April to May 2021, we detected SARS-CoV-2 in three out of 35 dogs and one out of nine cats from four out of 17 households with confirmed COVID-19 patients. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected from one of the nasal, oral, rectal and environmental swabs of dog-A (15 years old, mixed breed, male dog), cat-B (1 year old, domestic shorthair, male cat), dog-C (2 years old, mixed breed, female dog) and dog-D (4 years old, Pomeranian, female dog). The animals tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA from 4 to 30 days after pet owners were confirmed to be COVID-19 positive. The animals consecutively tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA for 4 to 10 days. One dog (dog-A) showed mild clinical signs, while the other dogs and a cat remained asymptomatic during quarantine at the hospitals. SARS-CoV-2 specific neutralizing antibodies were detected in both the dogs and cat by surrogate virus neutralization tests. Phylogenetic and genomic mutation analyses of whole genome sequences of three SARS-CoV-2 strains from the dogs and cat revealed SARS-CoV-2 of the Alpha variant (B.1.1.7 lineage). Our findings are suggestive of human-to-animal transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in COVID-19-positive households and contamination of viral RNA in the environment. Public awareness of SARS-CoV-2 infection in pet dogs and cats in close contact with COVID-19 patients should be raised.']"

However, little is known on which COS characteristics are responsible for its effect. The present study was designed to further study how COS characteristics: molecular weight (MW) and degree of deacetylation (DD); affect the growth performance, nutrient digestibility, and small intestinal modifications in weaning pigs. For this purpose, 48 weanling pigs were divided into 4 groups (12 animals per group) and received either a basal diet or a basal diet supplemented with 150 mg/kg of COS which differed in MW and DD: 8 kDa and ~90% DD (8 kDa~90%), 65 kDa and ~80% DD (65 kDa~80%), and 65 kDa and ~90% DD (65 kDa~90%). The experiment lasted 56 days. There were treatment effects on pigs’ body weight gain (BWG), average daily gain (ADG), average daily feed intake (ADFI), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), digestibility of crude protein, fat and calcium, small intestinal morphology and crypt cell proliferation (P <.05, respectively). Throughout the study, pigs supplemented with 8 kDa~90% COS showed significantly enhanced BWG, ADG, and ADFI when compared to those supplemented with 65 kDa~80% COS (P <.05, respectively). The enhanced growth performances in pigs supplemented with 8 kDa~90% COS was supported by an increase in ADFI (P <.05), and improved ileal digestibility of crude protein and crude fat (P <.01, respectively). Pigs supplemented with 8 kDa~90% COS also had increased absorption capacity as indicated by elongated villus height and increased villus height to crypt depth ratio of the small intestinal segments (P <.05, respectively), and more active cell division as indicated by increased Ki-67 marker at jejunal crypt cells (P <.05) on day 28 and 56 of the experiment. These data suggest that 8 kDa~90% might be the most effective form of COS to improve feed intake, and promote nutrient digestibility and absorption when supplemented at 150 mg/kg in the diet.', 'Microencapsulated basil oil (Ocimum basilicum Linn.) enhances growth performance, intestinal morphology, and antioxidant capacity of broiler chickens in the tropics Copyright  2022 by Animal BioscienceObjective: Microencapsulation is a technique to improve stability, bioavailability, and controlled release of active ingredients at a target site. This experiment aimed to investigate the effects of microencapsulated basil oil (MBO) on growth performance, apparent ileal digestibility (AID), jejunal histomorphology, bacterial population as well as antioxidant capacity of broiler chickens in a tropical climate. Methods: A total of 288 one-day-old female broilers (Ross 308) were randomly allocated into 4 groups (6 replicates of 12 birds), based on a completely randomized design. Dietary treatments were as follows: i) basal diet (NC), ii) basal diet with avilamycin at 10 ppm (PC), iii) basal diet with free basil oil (FBO) at 500 ppm, and iv) basal diet with MBO at 500 ppm, respectively. Results: Dietary supplementation of MBO improved average daily gain, and feed conversion ratio of broilers throughout the 42-d trial period (p<0.05), whereas MBO did not affect average daily feed intake compared with NC group. The broilers fed MBO diet exhibited a greater AID of crude protein and gross energy compared with those in other groups (p<0.05). Lactobacillus spp. and Escherichia coli populations were not affected by feeding dietary treatments. Both FBO and MBO had positive effects on jejunal villus height (VH), villus height to crypt depth ratio (VH:CD) and villus surface area of broilers compared to NC and PC groups (p<0.05). Superoxide dismutase level in the duodenal mucosa of MBO group was significantly increased (p<0.01), whereas malondialdehyde level was significantly decreased (p<0.01). Conclusion: Microencapsulation could be considered as a promising driver of the basil oil efficiency, consequently MBO at 500 ppm could be potentially used as a feed additive for improvement of intestinal integrity and nutrient utilization, leading to better performance of broiler chickens.', 'Efficacy of dietary chitosan on growth performance, haematological parameters and gut function in broilers  2017 The Author(s).

The objective of this experiment aimed to examine the effect of dietary chitosan in broilers on blood and intestinal changes. Total of 392, day-old male Ross 308 broilers were allotted into four groups. Broilers in the control group (group 1) received commercial corn-soybean meal-based basal diet. Chicks in group 2 received basal diet supplemented with 200 ppm amoxicillin. Chitosan was added into the basal diet at 1 and 2 g/kg in groups 3 and 4, respectively. Data on growth performance as well as blood and digesta samples were collected on d 21 and 39. The results showed that 2 g/kg dietary chitosan significantly improved feed conversion ratio (FCR) during d 22-39 and 1-39 (p <.05). This level of chitosan also increased the ratio of villus height (VH) and crypt depth (CD) (p <.05) while decreased the CD (p <.05). The supplementation of 1 and 2 g/kg chitosan in diet tended to reduce the ammonia-nitrogen in colonic digesta. Furthermore, both levels of chitosan enhanced number of Bacillus spp. while decreased number of E. coli (p <.001) leading to increased ratio of Lactobacillus and E. coli (p <.001). There were no significant effects on the heterophil (H): lymphocyte (L) ratio and coefficient of apparent ileal digestibility. In conclusion, the supplementation of 2 g/kg chitosan in broiler diets could be used as an alternative additive to antibiotic with its improvement on gut function.']"

There is minimal information about prevalence of CKD among family members of end stage renal disease (ESRD) patients. Objective: To investigate the prevalence of CKD among first-degree relatives of dialysis patients in Thailand. Materials and Methods: The present observational study was conducted in first degree relatives of dialysis patients at the Bhumirajanagarindra Kidney Institute. Participants aged between 18 and 60 years old were enrolled for CKD screening. CKD was defined by the KDIGO criteria. Results: One hundred seventy-nine participants were enrolled. The average age was 45.9±9.9 years and the average eGFR was 103.3±13 ml/minute/1.73 m². The median urine albumin creatinine ratio (UACR) was 7 (2 to 985) mg/g Cr.

The International Society of Nephrology, Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes committee promulgated clinical practice guidelines, which recommended the CKD-EPI equation. Investigators in Asia subsequently assessed the performance of these GFR estimating equations—the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease study equation, the CKD-EPI equation (creatinine only), and the CKD-EPI equations (creatinine and cystatin C). In this review, we summarize the studies performed in Asia on validating or establishing new Asian ethnicity GFR estimating equations.

However, there is limited information on the overall regional prevalence of CKD, as well as the variations in national prevalence within Asia. We aimed to consolidate available data and quantify estimates of the CKD burden in this region. Methods We systematically searched MEDLINE, Embase and Google Scholar for observational studies and contacted national experts to estimate CKD prevalence in countries of Asia (Eastern, Southern and South Eastern Asia). CKD was defined as estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) <60 mL/min/1.73 m 2 or the presence of proteinuria. For countries without reported data, we estimated CKD prevalence using agglomerative average-linkage hierarchical clustering, based on country-level risk factors and random effects meta-analysis within clusters. Published CKD prevalence data were obtained for 16 countries (of the 26 countries in the region) and estimates were made for 10 countries. Results There was substantial variation in overall and advanced (eGFR <30 mL/min/1.73 m 2) CKD prevalence (range: 7.0%-34.3% and 0.1%-17.0%, respectively). Up to an estimated 434.3 million (95% CI 350.2 to 519.7) adults have CKD in Asia, including up to 65.6 million (95% CI 42.2 to 94.9) who have advanced CKD. The greatest number of adults living with CKD were in China (up to 159.8 million, 95% CI 146.6 to 174.1) and India (up to 140.2 million, 95% CI 110.7 to 169.7), collectively having 69.1% of the total number of adults with CKD in the region. Conclusion The large number of people with CKD, and the substantial number with advanced CKD, show the need for urgent collaborative action in Asia to prevent and manage CKD and its complications.']"

To achieve high performance LIB, the surface-confined strategy has been applied to design and fabricate a new anode material of NiCo-LDH nanosheet anchored on the surface of Ti3C2 MXene (NiCo-LDH/Ti3C2). The ultra-thin, bended and wrinkled α-phase crystal with an interlayer spacing of 8.1 Å can arrange on the conductive substrates Ti3C2 MXene directly, resulting in high electrolyte diffusion ability and low internal resistance. Furthermore, chemical bond interactions between the highly conductive Ti3C2 MXene and NiCo-LDH nanosheets can greatly increase the ion and electron transport and reduce the volume expansion of NiCo-LDH during Li ion intercalation. As expected, the discharge capacity of 562 mAh g−1 at 5.0 A g−1 for 800 cycles without degradation can be achieved, rate capability and cycle performance are better than that of NiCo-LDH (~100 mAh g−1).

Chemical bonds have been demonstrated as the main linkage between MXene and NiMn-LDH to inhibit structure degradation. Furthermore, the size of NiMn-LDH nanosheets was reduced with the incorporation of MXene due to heterogeneous nucleation, resulting in faster ion transport and electron transfer. As expected, the rate performance and cycle stability of this hybrid material are significantly improved (1330 mAh g−1 at 0.1 A g−1 and 88.6% capacity retention over 3000 cycles), compared with those of the MXene and NiMn-LDH mixture (875 mAh g−1 at 0.1 A g−1 and 41.8% left after 3000 cycles), indicating that the oxygen bridge is critical in improving the internal cohesion of the hybrid materials.

Hence, a NiFe-LDH/Ti3C2 MXene hybrid with uniformly distributed NiFe-LDH nanoflakes decorated on MXene nanosheets through a simple hydrothermal reaction is prepared. Due to the synergism between the Ti3C2 MXene conductive frameworks and NiFe-LDH, NiFe-LDH/ Ti3C2 MXene shows a superior electrochemical property for lithium storage. Its reversible capacity is 898.9 mAh g-1 at 0.1 A g-1, and even at 1 A g-1, it still has 726.1 mAh g-1, without capacity reduction in lithium-ion half-cells. In addition, the corresponding lithium-ion capacitor shows a higher energy density and power density, showing huge application prospect in lithium storage.']"

The same pooled venom from each group was subjected to enzymatic, electrophoretic and proteomic analysis, including sublethal toxicity (0.1 mg/kg iv.) examined on bodily functions by comparing the venom compositional and functional profiles among venom specimens from juvenile, subadult and adult D. siamensis by correlating them with the renal pathophysiology in experimental rabbits. Results: The comparative studies revealed that juvenile venom possessed higher phospholipase A2, metalloproteinase and serine proteinase levels, while subadult and adult venoms contained more L-amino acid oxidase, phosphodiesterase, the Kunitz-type serine protease inhibitor, disintegrin families and endothelial growth factor. An in vivo study revealed that the adult and subadult venoms caused persistent hypotension and bradycardia, while thrombocytopenia was a more characteristic effect of juvenile venom. All venom age groups showed significant reductions in renal hemodynamics and electrolyte excretions. The juvenile venom caused a higher tubulonephrosis lesion score than adult and subadult venoms. Conclusions: The D. siamensis venom shows an ontogenetic shift in its compositions and activities. Renal function alterations after envenomation depend on either the synergistic actions of different venom components or the disproportionate expression between the concentrations of enzymatic and non-enzymatic proteins in each age venom group. The high proportion of enzymatic toxin proteins in the juvenile venom results in greater nephrotoxicity.']"

Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.This paper presents the first measurement of the investigation of the health impacts of indoor radon exposure and external dose from terrestrial radiation in Chiang Mai province during the dry season burning between 2018 and 2020. Indoor radon activity concentrations were carried out using a total of 220 RADUET detectors in 45 dwellings of Chiang Mai (7 districts) during burning and non-burning seasons. Results show that indoor radon activity concentration during the burning season (63 ± 33 Bq/m3) was significantly higher (p < 0.001) compared to the non-burning season (46 ± 19 Bq/m3), with an average annual value of 55 ± 28 Bq/m3. All values of indoor radon activity concentration were greater than the national (16 Bq/m3) and worldwide (39 Bq/m3) average values. In addition, the external dose from terrestrial radiation was measured using a car-borne survey during the burning season in 2018. The average absorbed rate in the air was 66 nGy/h, which is higher than the worldwide average value of 59 nGy/h. This might be due to the high activity concentrations of238U and323Th in the study area. With regards to the health risk assessment, the effective dose due to indoor radon exposure, external (outdoor) effective dose, and total annual effective dose were 1.6, 0.08, and 1.68 mSv/y, respectively. The total annual effective dose is higher than the worldwide average of 1.15 mSv/y. The excess lifetime cancer risk and radon-induced lung cancer risk during the burning season were 0.67% and 28.44 per million persons per year, respectively.

In this regard, radon and thoron measurement studies have been widely conducted all over the world. Generally, the techniques used relate to passive nuclear track detectors. Some surveys have shown that passive monitors for radon are sensitive to thoron, and hence some measured results have probably overestimated radon concentrations.

Research on characteristics and extent to which screen media are used in hospitalized children in addition to associated factors is scarce. This study aims to examine the duration and factors associated with screen media use in hospitalized children. From February to November 2020, a cross-sectional study was conducted in hospitalized children (age range 1–194 months, median age 44.5 (IQR 14–123.5) months) and their caregivers at a single tertiary care hospital using a media questionnaire combined with a thorough interview. Of 254 participants who were enrolled, 239 (94%) had been exposed to screen media in the hospital with a median duration of exposure of 6 (IQR 2–11) h/day. Children who used more than one screen media device (standardized beta (β) = 0.16, p < 0.001), having difficulty stopping media use (β = 0.16, p < 0.001), having lower numbers of positive discipline techniques over media use (β = 0.16, p = 0.001), and less media co-viewing with verbal interaction with their caregivers (β = 0.12, p = 0.004) were significantly associated with longer screen media use in a hospital setting.

Methodology: Five colleges were randomly selected from Inner Mongolia Medical University, and 100 undergraduate students were randomly selected from each college. A total of 500 students were investigated by questionnaire, including demographic characteristics, smartphone use behaviors, smartphone addition scale: Short Version (SAS-SV) (10 questions), life experience during COVID-19, Depression Anxiety Stress Scales (DASS-21) 21 questions. Univariate logistic regression analysis used binary logistical regression to explore the nature and significance of the relationship between dependent and independent variables. After putting the significant factors into multivariable logistic regression models to control any possible confounding factors, the factors significantly related to smartphone addiction and depression, anxiety, stress were proposed. Results: In the questionnaire survey (33.6% of males and 66.4% of females), the age range was 18 to 28 years old. Almost 277(55.4%) participants can be considered as smartphone addiction,233(44.6%) participants cannot be considered smartphone addiction.105 (21.0%) considered having depression, 153 (30.6%) had anxiety and 69 (13.8%) had stress.

This study aimed to examine whether age of onset of media exposure, cumulative effect of high media exposure, and verbal interaction during screen time in the first 2 years of life were associated with 4-year-old cognition by including parenting behaviors into the final construct. Methods: There were 274 healthy participants who were followed up until age 4 years. Screen media data were collected at age 6, 12, 18 months, and 2 years. Cognition or early learning composite (ELC) was evaluated at age 2, 3, and 4 years, where the latter variable was the primary outcome. Positive parenting was obtained by Parenting Styles and Dimensions Questionnaire. Results: ELC at age 2 years was associated with later age of onset of media exposure (β = 0.113, p < 0.05), fewer months of high media exposure above the upper quartile (β = 0.282, p < 0.001), and more months of verbal interaction during screen time (β = 0.261, p < 0.001). ELC at age 4 years was associated with ELC and positive parenting at earlier ages. Conclusion: Delayed introduction of screen media, appropriate screen time, and increased verbal interaction during media use in the first 2 years of life were associated with better cognitive development in preschoolers. Impact: Associations between screen media exposure and children’s cognitive development in existing literature mainly focused on duration of screen media viewing or the content of electronic media in which other factors are rarely explored.Earlier age of onset of media exposure, more months of excessive screen media exposure (>6.5 h/day), and fewer months of verbal interaction with children during media use in the first 2 years of life had associations with decreased preschool cognition.To mitigate undesirable effects of inappropriate screen media use on cognition, delayed introduction of screen media, appropriate electronic media exposure, and increased verbal interaction during media use with children should be recommended at health supervision visits.Lower positive parenting was a mediator for the relationship between cumulative months of high screen media exposure and decreased child cognition.']"

Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is a mosquito-borne virus belonging to the genus Alphavirus. The virus is transmitted to humans by the bite of infected female Aedes mosquitoes, primarily Aedes aegypti. CHIKV infection is spreading worldwide, and it periodically sparks new outbreaks. There are no specific drugs or effective vaccines against CHIKV. The interruption of pathogen transmission by mosquito control provides the only effective approach to the control of CHIKV infection. Many studies have shown that CHIKV can be transmitted among the Ae. aegypti through vertical transmission. The previous chikungunya fever outbreaks in Thailand during 2008–2009 were caused by CHIKV, the East/Central/South African (ECSA) genotype. Recently, there have been 3794 chikungunya cases in 27 provinces reported by the Bureau of Epidemiology of Health Ministry, Thailand during 1 January–16 June 2019; however, the cause of the re-emergence of CHIKV outbreaks is uncertain. Therefore, the aims of this study were to detect and analyze the genetic diversity of CHIKV infection in field-caught mosquitoes. Both female and male Ae. aegypti were collected from endemic areas of Thailand, and CHIKV detection was done by using E1-nested RT-PCR and sequencing analysis. A total of 1646 Ae. aegypti samples (900 females and 746 males) were tested. CHIKV was detected in 54 (3.28%) and 14 samples (0.85%) in female and male mosquitoes, respectively. Seventeen samples of female Ae. aegypti collected from the Ubon Ratchathani, Chiang Rai, Chiang Mai, Nakhon Sawan, and Songkhla provinces found mutation at E1: A226V. Interestingly, E1: K211E mutation was observed in 50 samples collected from Nong Khai, Bangkok, Prachuap Khiri Khan, and Krabi. In addition, the phylogenetic tree indicated that CHIKV in Ae. aegypti samples were from the Indian Ocean Clade and East/South African Clade. Both clades belong to the ECSA genotype. The information obtained from this study could be used for prediction, epidemiological study, prevention, and effective vector control of CHIKV. For instance, a novel CHIKV strain found in new areas has the potential to lead to a new outbreak.

CHIKV infection has become a major public health concern worldwide, as it has a significant impact on the healthcare system. Since 2004, the virus has emerged in Africa and subsequently spread to countries located near the Indian Ocean, including India, and to Europe, the Americas, and Asia. In Thailand, a large CHIKV outbreak occurred during 2008–2009 and was caused by a virus originating from the east/central/south African (ECSA) CHIKV genotype. Since then, the ECSA genotype of CHIKV has continued to circulate and has caused sporadic cases in different areas in Thailand. Approximately 20,000 reported cases have been confirmed by the Bureau of Epidemiology, Ministry of Public Health, Thailand, from January 1, 2018 to July 31, 2020. However, the causes of this CHIKV re-emergence remain unclear. To obtain a better understanding of CHIKV circulation during the recent outbreak in Bangkok, Thailand, complete genome analysis of CHIKV isolates from field-caught mosquitoes collected in outbreak areas was performed. A total of 28 Ae. aegypti samples (21 females and 7 males) were collected, and individual mosquitoes were used for CHIKV detection and isolation. Eleven of 28 (39.29%) female and three of 28 (10.71%) male mosquitoes were positive for CHIKV by E1 nested RT-PCR. Four CHIKV isolates were successfully isolated from four female Ae. aegypti mosquitoes. Based on complete genome analysis, several amino acid substitutions were identified in the protein coding region. The E1:K211E and E2:V264A mutations in the background of the E1:226A mutation were observed in all four CHIKV isolates. An important observation was the presence of one amino acid substitution, leading to an E1:K245R change. This mutation was found in all four CHIKV isolates from mosquitoes in this study and in Thai patients described previously. Additionally, phylogenetic analysis indicated that the four CHIKV isolates belonged to the Indian Ocean clade of the ECSA genotype.

These viruses are transmitted to humans through the bites of Aedes mosquitoes. Recently, ZIKV infection has been described as an emerging disease in Thailand and many countries, especially in tropical and sub-tropical areas. Specific drugs and vaccines against these infections are unavailable; therefore, effective disease control relies on vector control measures only. To understand the transmission cycle of these viruses and mosquito vectors, this study is designed to investigate the natural infection of ZIKV, CHIKV and DENV in field-caught mosquitoes by molecular techniques. Adults and larvae of mosquitoes were collected in and around the patients' homes in the Klaeng District, Rayong Province, Thailand. CHIKV and DENV were detected by Multiplex Real-time RT-PCR and ZIKV was detected by Hemi-nested RT-PCR. ZIKV RNA was detected in 8 (10.3%) samples (5 (6.4%) females and 2 (2.6%) males of Aedes aegypti and 1 (1.3%) female Armigeres subalbatus) and CHIKV RNA in 5 (6.4%) (3 (3.8%) females and 2 (2.6%) larvae of Ae. aegypti), while DENV RNA was not detected in any samples. The Maximum Likelihood tree of nucleotide sequences of positive samples showed that ZIKV in mosquitoes were cladded within the Asian lineage. This study was a preliminary survey of the potential vectors of ZIKV, CHIKV and DENV in an affected area. Information obtained from this study helps to understand the natural infection rates in mosquitoes with ZIKV, CHIKV and DENV and may be valuable in creating the most effective mosquito vector control strategies in the future.""]"

The combined processes were simulated using oxygen as a gasifying agent and the oil palm trunk, the agricultural waste generated from the palm oil industry, as feedstock.

Utilization of hydrogen available as a by-product from other processes may resolve such issue. In this work; therefore, we evaluate the potentiality of incorporating the hydrogen by-product from the NaOCH3 production for the synthesis of methanol via hydrogenation of CO2, a greenhouse gas released from industry. Due to the limited availability of hydrogen from NaOCH3 production, a detailed analysis of kinetic in the reactor systems including, 1) the adiabatic fixed bed, 2) the isothermal multi-tube, and 3) the adiabatic fixed-bed reactors with an intercooler, are simulated using Aspen Plus in order to select the most appropriate reactor system that maximizes the conversion of hydrogen and CO2. The adiabatic fixed bed reactor appears the most appropriate since it consumes the highest amount of CO2, and shows the highest Profitability Index when compared to other reactor systems. In addition, methanol produced from this proposed process can provide a 16.4% reduction in the methanol feedstock required for the upstream process of NaOCH3 production. An analysis using Aspen Economic is also performed in this work which reveals that the saving cost generated from the recycle of methanol to the upstream process is almost comparable to the costs of construction and operation of the process of methanol synthesis. According to our useful sensitivity analysis, a methanol price as well as hydrogen and CO2 feed rates directly influenced the feasibility of the proposed process. The obtained result indicates that this proposed process is potentially feasible when 1) the price of methanol increases, and 2) the availability of hydrogen increases due to the increased NaOCH3 production capacity over than 1.5 times of the current scale.', 'Techno-economic analysis of hydrogen production from dehydrogenation and steam reforming of ethanol for carbon dioxide conversion to methanol  2021 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLCDecreasing carbon dioxide (CO2) emission by converting to higher-valued product has become of interest. Hydrogen (H2) is an important feedstock required in thermochemical conversion of CO2 to chemicals such as methanol. The cost and availability of H2 affect the cost of CO2 conversion. This study is focused on the process simulation of H2 production from ethanol feedstock. Steam reforming of ethanol is compared with dehydrogenation of ethanol to H2 with valued products including ethyl acetate and acetaldehyde. Form this study, steam reforming of ethanol presents the lowest cost of H2 production at 1.58 USD/kg H2 while dehydrogenation of ethanol presents the cost at 3.24 and 1.97 USD/kg H2, respectively. Although presenting the lowest cost, steam reforming of ethanol provides a net positive CO2 emission in the overall CO2 conversion to methanol process. In contrast, ethanol dehydrogenation to H2 and byproducts, ethyl acetate and acetaldehyde, promotes a net negative CO2 emission of −819.20 kg/ton methanol and −5.42 kg/ton methanol, respectively. The results present a decreasing CO2 emission with an increasing cost of H2 production.']"

To overcome this limitation, more extensive information about drugs and diseases such as gene ontology terms, functional annotations of genes and gene products, could be used.

Cross-validation and the Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (AUROC) were then used to qualify the best model in the drug-Target association prediction. The result shows that the model using the similarity measures based on drug-disease associations and target protein sequences significantly outperforms the other models and the original model. Overall, our best model yields an accuracy of 93.5%. In conclusion, the heterogeneous model with optimal similarity measures is a well-suited approach to predict a new target for a certain drug.']"

The Lewis acid transformation on the catalysts was investigated by in situ diffuse reﬂectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) of adsorbed NH3 at 100 °C under atmospheric pressure for 130 min. According to the results of in situ DRIFTS, ammonia migration from Lewis acid sites to Bronsted acid sites occurred over the WOx catalysts supported on all different supports. It is proposed that the partial reduction of WOx occurred under the hydrogen atmosphere, resulting in the generation of oxygen vacancies sites. The generated oxygen vacancies of the supported WOx catalysts were found to play an important role for activating the hydrogen spillover, leading to Lewis acid transformation to Bronsted acid. It was suggested that the selected support is the crucial factor for Lewis acid transformation performances. The results from our experiments showed that the weak interaction between WOx and support led to the easy reduction of W species, which promoted the generation of oxygen vacancies sites. The large amount of oxygen vacancies leads to high Lewis acid transformation. Moreover, the influence of different supports was discussed and investigated by several analytical techniques such as H2-TPD, H2-TPR, O2-TPD, UV–vis, XRD, XPS, and TEM-EDS techniques.', 'Differences in acid and catalytic properties of W incorporated spherical SiO2 and 1%Al-doped SiO2 in propene metathesis  2020Propene self-metathesis to ethylene and 2-butene was investigated over tungsten-based catalysts (9 wt.% W) supported on silica and 1%Al-doped SiO2, prepared by different processes. On pure SiO2, incorporating WOx improved tungsten dispersion and formation of active tetrahedral WOx species, compared to the impregnated ones. However, negative effect was found when tungsten was incorporated in the 1%Al-doped SiO2 as the catalysts contained more crystalline WOx, lower tetrahedral species, and lower Lewis acid sites, compared to the W-imp 1Al2O3/SiO2 prepared by impregnation. Incorporating both W and Al in the SiO2 by sol-gel method may lead to suppression of bridge hydroxyl Si(OH)Al group, as a consequence more crystalline WOx was formed. Nevertheless, the abundance of Bronsted and Lewis acid was found to play important role in the propene metathesis and the secondary metathesis of 1-butene reactions than surface silanol and the presence of tetrahedral tungsten oxide species on the 1%Al-doped SiO2 supported catalysts.', 'Effects of calcination and pretreatment temperatures on the catalytic activity and stability of H2-treated WO3/SiO2 catalysts in metathesis of ethylene and 2-butene  The Royal Society of Chemistry.The effects of calcination and pretreatment temperatures of the H2-treated WO3/SiO2 catalysts in metathesis of ethylene and 2-butene to propylene were investigated. The results showed that pretreatment with pure hydrogen over the non-calcined catalysts resulted in higher activity and stability than the calcined catalysts, and the hydrogen pretreatment temperature at 650 °C offered the highest 2-butene conversion and propylene selectivity. The calcination of the catalyst before hydrogen pretreatment was proved to be unnecessary. As revealed by various characterization results from N2 physisorption, XRD, TEM, UV-Vis, Raman, in situ H2-TPR, in situ NH3-DRIFTS and in situ NH3-TPD techniques, activity of the metathesis of ethylene and 2-butene to propylene was related to tungsten dispersion on the support, WO2.83 and WO2 phase composition, and isolated surface tetrahedral tungsten oxide species. The stability of the metathesis reaction was also related to the total acidity and the acid sites of both Brønsted and Lewis acid sites.']"

One of the methods to improve oxidation stability is partially hydrogenated fatty acid methyl esters (H-FAME). The present research studied the novel production technique of H-FAME derived from soybean FAME using non-thermal parallel-plate dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) plasma. This green hydrogenation method does not require a catalyst and can be performed under atmospheric pressure and at room temperature. The reaction using DBD plasma could effectively initiate the hydrogenation reaction, and the results showed similar performance to catalysis technique. The optimized process parameters for 35 mL of FAME were 25% H2, 5.5 hours of reaction time, and ambient temperature. This condition exhibited the highest conversion of polyunsaturated FAMEs (C18:2 and C18:3) and the highest yield of C18:1. DBD plasma hydrogenation resulted in the reduction of iodine value from 128 to 67.4. The oxidation stability was enhanced from 2.13 to 10 hours while the cloud point increased from −1°C to 11°C (still within the ASTM D6751 standard). This plasma process is a new alternative and eco-friendly method for H-FAME production.', 'Non-thermal dielectric barrier discharge plasma hydrogenation for production of margarine with low trans-fatty acid formation  2020 Elsevier LtdA novel technique for palm oil hydrogenation with very low trans-fatty acid formation using non-thermal dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) plasma with parallel-plate configuration has been successfully demonstrated. This green technique does not require catalyst and is highly environmental-friendly. With 15% H2: 85% He mixed carrier gas concentration ratio and initial 31 °C (rising to 50 °C due to plasma), after 4 h of plasma hydrogenation, iodine value (IV) was reduced from 60.89 to 48.39 and detected trans-fat was 1.44%. This represents trans-fat generation rate of only 0.07% per % decrease in IV, which is about 6.12 times lower than a conventional method relying on high temperature, high pressure and catalyst. About 8 h was required to produce margarine with texture closest to commercial margarines. Acid value (AV) reduced from 0.47 to 0.27%, or 43% reduction, after 12–20 h of treatment, significantly indicating that plasma hydrogenation can also help extend shelf life of oil or margarine. Large portion of DBD plasma hydrogenated palm oil can, thus, be mixed with palm olein and interesterified palm oil to produce margarine with overall trans-fatty acid content no higher than regulatory requirement. Continuous production scheme was presented. This novel plasma hydrogenation technique offers promising possibility for commercial utilization by edible oils industry.', 'Low-temperature and atmospheric pressure plasma for palm biodiesel hydrogenation  2021, The Author(s).Partially hydrogenated fatty acid methyl ester (H-FAME) is conventionally produced through partial hydrogenation under high pressure and elevated temperature in the presence of a catalyst. Herein, a novel green, catalyst-free, non-thermal and atmospheric pressure dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) plasma was employed instead of a conventional method to hydrogenate palm FAME. H-FAME became more saturated with the conversion of C18:2 and C18:3 of 47.4 and 100%, respectively, at 100 W input power, 1 mm gas-filled gap size and 80% H2 in the mixed gas at room temperature for 5 h, causing a reduction of the iodine value from 50.2 to 43.5. Oxidation stability increased from 12.8 to 20 h while a cloud point changed from 13.5 to 16 °C. Interestingly, DBD plasma hydrogenation resulted in no trans-fatty acid formation which provided a positive effect on the cloud point. This green DBD plasma system showed a superior performance to a conventional catalytic reaction. It is an alternative method that is safe from explosion due to the mild operating condition, as well as being highly environmentally friendly by reducing waste and energy utilization from the regeneration process required for a catalytic process. This novel green plasma hydrogenation technique could also be applied to other liquid-based processes.']"

Generally, ICIs produced in mammalian cells requires high investment, production costs, and involves time consuming procedures. Recently, the plants are considered as an emerging protein production platform due to its cost-effectiveness and rapidity for the production of recombinant biopharmaceuticals. This study explored the potential of plant-based system to produce an anti-human PD-1 monoclonal antibody (mAb), Pembrolizumab, in Nicotiana benthamiana. The transient expression of this mAb in wild-type N. benthamiana accumulated up to 344.12 ± 98.23 μg/g fresh leaf weight after 4 days of agroinfiltration. The physicochemical and functional characteristics of plant-produced Pembrolizumab were compared to mammalian cell-produced commercial Pembrolizumab (Keytruda®). Sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and western blot analysis results demonstrated that the plant-produced Pembrolizumab has the expected molecular weight and is comparable with the Keytruda®. Structural characterization also confirmed that both antibodies have no protein aggregation and similar secondary and tertiary structures. Furthermore, the plant-produced Pembrolizumab displayed no differences in its binding efficacy to PD-1 protein and inhibitory activity between programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) and programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) interaction with the Keytruda®. In vitro efficacy for T cell activation demonstrated that the plant-produced Pembrolizumab could induce IL-2 and IFN-γ production.

PD-1/PD-L1 pathway has emerged as one of the major targets in cancer immunotherapy. Atezolizumab, the first anti-PD-L1 antibody approved for the treatment of metastatic urothelial, non-small cell lung, small cell lung and triple-negative breast cancers, is produced in Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells with several limitations i.e., high-production costs, low-capacity yields, and contamination risks. Due to the rapid scalability and low production costs, the transient expression in Nicotiana benthamiana leaves was investigated by co-infiltration of Agrobacterium tumefaciens GV3101 cultures harboring the nucleic acid sequences encoding for Atezolizumab heavy chain and light chain in this study. The transient expression of Atezolizumab in transformed N. benthamiana accumulated up to 86.76 μg/g fresh leaf weight after 6 days of agroinfiltration (OD 600 nm: 0.4) with 1:1 ratio of heavy chain to light chain. The structural and functional characteristics of plant-produced Atezolizumab was compared with commercially available Tecentriq® from CHO cells with similar binding efficacies to PD-L1 receptor. The direct anti-cancer effect of plant-produced anti-PD-L1 was further performed in human lung metastatic cancer cells H460 cultured under detachment condition, demonstrating the activity of anti-PD-L1-antibody on sensitizing anoikis as well as the suppression on anti-apoptosis proteins (Bcl-2 and Mcl-1) and modulation of epithelial to mesenchymal regulating proteins (E-cadherin, N-cadherin, Snail and Slug).

The frequently used immunotherapy agents are immune checkpoint inhibitors, such as antibodies specific to PD1, PD-L1, or CTLA-4. However, these drugs are highly expensive, and most people in the world cannot access the treatment. The development of recombinant protein production platforms that are cost-effective, scalable, and safe is needed. Plant platforms are attractive because of their low production cost, speed, scalability, lack of human and animal pathogens, and post-translational modifications that enable them to produce effective monoclonal antibodies. In this study, an anti-PD1 IgG4 monoclonal antibody (mAb) was transiently produced in Nicotiana benthamiana leaves. The plant-produced anti-PD1 mAb was compared to the commercial nivolumab produced in CHO cells. Our results showed that both antibodies have similar protein structures, and the N-glycans on the plant-produced antibody lacks plant-specific structures. The PD1 binding affinity of the plant-produced and commercial nivolumab, determined by two different techniques, that is, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and surface plasmon resonance (SPR), are also comparable. Plant-produced nivolumab binds to human PD1 protein with high affinity and specificity, blocks the PD-1/PD-L1 interaction, and enhances T cell function, comparable to commercial nivolumab. These results confirmed that plant-produced anti-PD1 antibody has the potential to be effective agent for cancer immunotherapy.']"

Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the American Society of Animal Science. All rights reserved.African swine fever (ASF) is an important transboundary animal disease with a high mortality rate. The high African swine fever virus (ASFV) titers in the excretion of infected wild boar possibly contaminate the feed ingredient. Once contaminated, it could support persistent residual titer of the ASFV. The chemical inactivation of imported feed ingredients is a precautionary risk management measure to restrict the import risk of ASFV through international trade. The log ASFV titers were linearly reduced as a function of the inactivation time after exposure to 0.03%, 0.05%, 0.1%, and 0.2% formaldehyde-based product (FBP). A four-log reduction of ASFV titer was achieved after exposure to 0.2% FBP and 0.03%–0.1% FBP for 30-min and 60-min inactivation times, respectively. The decimal reduction time or D value is defined as the time required to inactivate the virus titer by 1 log. The ASFV inactivation rate from the independent experiment of FBP concentration was converted to a D value. The observed mean D0.2%, D0.1%, D0.05%, and D0.03% of FBP were 13.4, 44.9, 45.0, and 45.3 min per log reduction of ASFV, respectively. The interpretation of D0.2% of FBP is that the ASFV titer is inactivated by 1 log after being exposed to 0.2% FBP for every 13.4 min. A more effective chemical has a lower D value because of a shorter inactivation time required to achieve the same 1-log reduction. In addition, the hypothetical inactivation time by any chemical additive is scenario-specific and is calculated by the product of D value (at a certain concentration) and log titers of residual ASFV. This study introduces the concept and application of the D value to compare the virucidal activity of chemicals and to determine the hypothetical inactivation time of chemicals depending on the chemical concentration including the virus titer in the feed.', ""Inactivation rates of African swine fever virus by compound disinfectants  2022African swine fever is an important viral disease of domestic pigs and wild boars. Inactivation of the African swine fever virus (ASFV) contaminating equipment and premises is an effective biosecurity risk management measure to prevent the introduction of ASFV through contaminated fomites and the environment. Even though some chemical agents' virucidal activity against ASFV was previously demonstrated, compound disinfectants are still limited. For the fact that the ASFV titer in some excretions from pigs was far >4 log. Even after the application of disinfectants as instructed by the manufacturers, the excessive ASFV load in the excretions from pigs could contaminate fomites or the environment. To solve this dilemma, the concept of contact time of disinfectant for 1–log reduction was introduced, as the decimal reduction time or D value. Therefore, the objective of this study was to assess the inactivation rate of four compound disinfectants against ASFV as the D value. Four compound disinfectants (iodine and phenol, quaternary ammonium and alcohol, and two quaternary ammonium and glutaraldehyde compounds) currently used in the veterinary field were evaluated in a suspension test at 25 °C in the absence of interfering substances. Primary porcine alveolar macrophages were used to determine the titer of ASFV genotype II (strain VNUA/HY-ASF1/Vietnam/2019). The virucidal activity of four compound disinfectants achieved 4–log ASFV reduction. The mean D0.5%, D0.25%, and D0.125% values of all disinfectants inactivating ASFV were 1.62–3.60, 2.60–3.8, and 2.89–3.90 min, respectively. The D value of disinfectants allows users to manipulate the appropriate concentration and/or contact time of the disinfectant, depending on the magnitude of ASFV contamination, to completely inactivate the ASFV titer on the fomites to minimise a potential biosecurity risk."", 'Persistence of African swine fever virus on porous and non-porous fomites at environmental temperatures  2022, The Author(s).Background: African swine fever (ASF) is a lethal contagious disease affecting both domestic pigs and wild boars. Even though it is a non-zoonotic disease, ASF causes economic loss in swine industries across continents. ASF control and eradication are almost impossible since effective vaccines and direct antiviral treatment are not available. The persistence of ASFV on fomites plays an important role in the indirect transmission of ASFV to pigs encountering ASFV-contaminated fomites. ASFV persistence on porous and non-porous fomites (glass, metal, rubber, and cellulose paper) at different environmental temperatures was determined. The persistence of ASFV of fomites was determined by the rate of ASFV inactivation in terms of DT, or the time required to reduce ASFV per 1 log at each selected environmental temperature (T). DT is used to compare the persistence of ASFV on the fomites. Results: The mean D25, D33, and D42, of dried infectious ASFV on glass, metal, rubber, and paper were in the ranges 1.42–2.42, 0.72–1.94, and 0.07–0.23 days, respectively. The multiple DT were used to develop a DT model to predict the DT for some other environmental temperatures. The DT models to predict the persistence of dried infectious ASFV on glass, metal, rubber, and paper are log DT = (− T/21.51) + 1.34, log DT = (− T/20.42) + 1.47, log DT = (− T/14.91) + 2.03, and log DT = (− T/10.91) + 2.84, respectively. A spreadsheet as a quick and handy tool predicting the persistence time of dried infectious ASFV on fomites at various environmental temperatures based on these DT models is available for public to download. Conclusion: Persistence of dried infectious ASFV on paper are significantly the longest at lower environmental temperatures whereas that of dried infectious ASFV on paper is significantly the shortest at higher environmental temperature.']"

On the other hand, power generation still relies on fossil fuels. A ground source heat pump (GSHP) is an alternative to reducing the energy required for cooling and heating in many countries. The use of a GSHP in a tropical climate like Southeast Asia is mainly for cooling (i.e., heat rejection), and the temperature differences between soil background and atmosphere are low throughout the year. This paper addresses the potential use of GSHP in Southeast Asia based on short-term performance data. Four GSHP systems have been installed in Thailand and Vietnam. Data gathered from the short-term operations provides important insights on GSHP performance. A comparison with an air source heat pump (ASHP) indicates that a GSHP installed at the Bangkok, using two vertical ground heat exchangers (GHEs), achieves a maximum of 33% electricity reduction. Similarly, GSHPs installed at the Saraburi site using horizontal GHEs achieves a maximum of 18.5% and 40.3% less electricity during highest and lowest temperature seasons, respectively, compared with an ASHP. The results also show that parallel–series arrangement improves the thermal performance than those of series–parallel arrangements. Considering the wide temperature climate range of Hanoi, a GSHP can also be used for heating purposes during a short winter period. While the short-term results discussed in this paper suggest the potential use of GSHP in Southeast Asia, further long-term analysis, cost evaluations and system optimization are required.', 'Numerical simulations on potential application of ground source heat pumps with vertical ground heat exchangers in Bangkok and Hanoi  2021 The AuthorsSoutheast Asian countries have experienced fast economic growth for several decades. This rapid growth has been accompanied by an increased energy demand per capita. Ground source heat pumps could be a solution to improve energy efficiency. However, there are several concerns with the introduction of this technology. Unlike in four-season countries, where a seasonal balance between cooling and heating demand exists, the use of ground source heat pumps in Southeast Asia is primarily for cooling. The temperature difference between the ground and air is also small. In this paper, we evaluate the first thermal response test results ever performed in Southeast Asia at sites in Bangkok and Hanoi. Borehole heat exchanger models were established on the basis of the apparent thermal conductivities according to the thermal response test results. The borehole heat exchanger models were then used to evaluate the five-year performance of a ground source heat pump in a typical small-sized detached office building under specific climatic conditions. The increasing borehole heat exchanger temperature is unavoidable because of the absence of heat extraction. Consequently, the coefficient of performance decreasing, along with the increasing power consumption, over time. Yet, the results indicating that the ground source heat pump can still provide good thermal performance. We also evaluated the effect of the number of boreholes on the ground source heat pump performance. The results indicate that the maximum coefficient of performance can be relatively improved by 16.1% and 14.9% in Bangkok and Hanoi, respectively, using 10 instead of 6 boreholes.', 'Ground-source heat pumps with horizontal heat exchangers for space cooling in the hot tropical climate of Thailand  2019 by the authors.The cooling of spaces in tropical regions, such as Southeast Asia, consumes a lot of energy. Additionally, rapid population and economic growth are resulting in an increasing demand for space cooling. The ground-source heat pump has been proven a reliable, cost-effective, safe, and environmentally-friendly alternative for cooling and heating spaces in various countries. In tropical countries, the presumption that the ground-source heat pump may not provide better thermal performance than the normal air-source heat pump arises because the difference between ground and atmospheric temperatures is essentially low. This paper reports the potential use of a ground-source heat pump with horizontal heat exchangers in a tropical country-Thailand. Daily operational data of two ground-source heat pumps and an air-source heat pump during a two-month operation are analyzed and compared. Life cycle cost analysis and CO2 emission estimation are adopted to evaluate the economic value of ground-source heat pump investment and potential CO2 reduction through the use of ground-source heat pumps, in comparison with the case for air-source heat pumps. It was found that the ground-source heat pumps consume 17.1% and 18.4% less electricity than the air-source heat pump during this period. Local production of heat pumps and heat exchangers, as well as rapid regional economic growth, can be positive factors for future ground-source heat pump application, not only in Thailand but also southeast Asian countries.']"

The structural diversity found in the system mainly resulted from the effects of anions, solvents, and the variation in the ionic radii of the lanthanide(iii) ions.

Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the American Society for Nutrition.This systematic review aimed to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of probiotics for glycemic control in adults with impaired glucose control, including prediabetes and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). We searched PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane databases, and trial registries up to February 2019. We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of participants with prediabetes or T2DM. Eligible trials compared probiotics versus either placebo, no intervention, or comparison probiotics, or compared synbiotics versus prebiotics. Primary outcomes were mean change in fasting blood glucose (FBG) and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) from baseline to short term (<12 wk) and long term (≥12 wk). We performed meta-analyses using the random-effects model. We included 28 RCTs (1947 participants). Overall, probiotics reduced FBG more than the placebo/no intervention group with a mean difference (MD) of -12.99 mg/dL (95% CI: -23.55, -2.42; P value: 0.016) over the short term; and -2.99 mg/dL (95% CI: -5.84, -0.13; P value: 0.040) over the long term. There was also some evidence for reduced HbA1c in the probiotics group at both short term (MD: -0.17; 95% CI: -0.37, 0.02; P value: 0.084) and long term (MD: -0.14; 95% CI: -0.34, 0.06; P value: 0.172), however, these did not reach statistical significance possibly because only a few trials reported HbA1c as an outcome. Subgroup analyses showed a greater reduction in HbA1c in participants not receiving insulin therapy than those receiving insulin therapy. Furthermore, the effect of probiotics on the reduction of FBG was more pronounced in participants with FBG >130 mg/dL and those not receiving insulin therapy than their counterparts. Probiotics were also effective in lowering serum cholesterol over the short and long term. In conclusion, we found that probiotics may have a glucose-lowering effect in T2DM participants. The effect appeared to be stronger in participants with poorly controlled diabetes and those not on insulin therapy.

With the proposed pathophysiology of alcohol-induced liver injury to be related to deranged gut microbiota, we hypothesized that probiotics would have beneficial effects in attenuating alcohol-induced liver injury. Methods: Twenty-four male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into 4 groups: control group, alcohol group, Lactobacillus plantarum group, and mixed-strain probiotics group. After 4 weeks, all rats were sacrificed, and blood samples were analyzed for ALT, lipopolysaccharide level (LPS), interleukin 6 (IL-6), and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α). Liver tissues were processed for histopathology, malondialdehyde (MDA) level and immunohistochemistry for toll-like receptors 4 (TLR-4). Stool samples were collected, and 16S rRNA sequencing was used to analyze the fecal microbiota. Results: Liver histopathology showed the presence of significant hepatocyte ballooning in the alcohol group as compared with the control group, and the treatment with L. plantarum or mixed-strain probiotics alleviated these changes. Significant elevation of serum ALT, LPS, IL-6, and TNF-α, hepatic MDA levels, and hepatic TLR-4 expression were observed in alcohol-fed rats as compared with control rats. The administration of L. plantarum or mixed-strain probiotics restored these changes to the levels of control rats. The relative abundance of fecal bacteria at genus level showed a significant reduction in Allobaculum, Romboutsia, Bifidobacterium, and Akkermansia in the alcohol group as compared with the control group. In probiotics-treated rats, significant increases in Allobaculum and Bifidobacterium were observed, while the relative abundance of Romboutsia and Akkermansia was unchanged compared to the alcohol group. A reduction in alpha diversity was observed in alcohol-treated rats, whereas the improvement was noted after probiotic treatment. Conclusions: The treatment with Lactobacillus, whether as single-, or mixed-strain probiotics, was beneficial in reducing the severity of alcohol-induced liver injury likely through the increase in beneficial bacteria, and the reduction of inflammatory responses, and oxidative stress.', 'Impact of probiotic supplementation and the role of gut microbiome in obesity  2022 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.Obesity is an outcome of irregular energy intake and balance, changes in gut microbiota, and improper diet, which is further influenced by the host’s genetic makeup and environmental factors. Several studies in vitro, in vivo, and human clinical trials have highlighted the influence of fermented food and microbes on obesity-associated consequences. They include probiotics, prebiotics, and synbiotics. Probiotics are defined as viable microorganisms that reach the intestine in an active state sufficient to exert positive health benefits. A prebiotic is “a selectively fermented ingredient that allows specific changes, both in the composition and/or activity in the gastrointestinal microbiota that confers benefits upon host well-being and health.” A synbiotic is a synergistic combination of both pre and probiotics. Here we try to explain the factors influencing obesity, the role of microbiome, and probiotic intervention in obesity. These effects could be attributed to their ability to alter the intestinal microbiota, remodeling the energy metabolism, alter the expression of genes related to thermogenesis, glucose metabolism, and lipid metabolism, and change the parasympathetic nerve activity. Further in-depth studies are necessary to identify the best probiotic or synbiotic mixture, optimum dosage, duration of the intervention, and mode of action to reduce obesity.']"

The objective of the present study was to investigate the antimelanogenic effect of ethanol extracts of Croton roxburghii (CRE) and Croton sublyratus (CSE) leaves on cellular melanin content and cellular tyrosinase activity as mediated by the action of microthalmia transcription factor (MITF) and melanogenic enzymes. Croton roxburghii and Croton sublyratus leaves were extracted by petroleum ether, dichloromethane and absolute ethanol, sequentially. The ethanolic crude extracts were examined for antimelanogenic activity by their ability to decrease melanin content and cellular tyrosinase activity in alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone-stimulated B16F10 melanoma cells. In addition, the extracts were evaluated to determine a plausible mechanism of melanogenesis suppression through determining the activation of MITF transcription factor and melanogenic proteins (tyrosinase, tyrosinase-related protein 1 or TRP-1 and tyrosinase-related protein 2 or TRP-2) at the transcriptional and translation levels in α-MSH-induced B16F10 cells.

Tyrosinase is a key enzyme in melanogenesis and thus a target for reducing melanin production. Although abalone is a good source of bioactive peptides that have been used for several properties including depigmentation, the available information on the anti-tyrosinase property of abalone peptides remains insufficient. This study investigated the anti-tyrosinase properties of Haliotis diversicolor tyrosinase inhibitory peptides (hdTIPs) based on mushroom tyrosinase, cellular tyrosinase, and melanin content assays. The binding conformation between peptides and tyrosinase was also examined by molecular docking and dynamics study. KNN1 showed a high potent inhibitory effect on mushroom tyrosinase with an IC50 of 70.83 μM. Moreover, our selected hdTIPs could inhibit melanin production through the reductions in tyrosinase activity and reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels by enhancing the antioxidative enzymes. RF1 showed the highest activity on both cellular tyrosinase inhibition and ROS reduction. leading to the lower melanin content in B16F10 murine melanoma cells. Accordingly, it can be assumed that our selected peptides exhibited high potential in medical cosmetology applications.']"

Data from both all-atom MD and a coarse-grained MC simulations show that the radius of gyration of the protein (the cytoplasmic domain of hHv1 monomer and dimer)decreases on increasing the temperature, i.e. it becomes more globular on heating in its native phase in contrast to its thermal expansion in denatured phase. The globularization of the protein is quantified by analyzing the scaling of the structure factor.

Visual inspections show distinct structures, i.e., isolated globular bundles to entangled network on multiple length scales in dilute to crowded protein concentrations. In native phase, the radius of gyration of the protein does not vary much with the protein concentration while that of its inner segment increases systematically. In contrast, the radius of gyration of the protein shows enormous growth with the concentration due to entanglement while that of the inner segment remains almost constant in denatured phase. The multi-scale morphology of the collective assembly is quantified by estimating the effective dimension D of protein from scaling of the structure factor: collective assembly from inner segments remains globular (D~3) at almost all length scales in its native phase while that from protein chains shows sparsely distributed morphology with D <2 in entire temperature range due to entanglement except in crowded environment at low temperature where D~2.6. Higher morphological response of chains with only the inner-segments due to selective interactions in its native phase may be more conducive to self-organizing mechanism than that of the remaining segments of the protein chains.']"

Bio-based benzoxazine resin is prepared from vanillin, furfurylamine, and paraformaldehyde by utilizing the Mannich-like condensation. Vanillin-furfurylamine-containing benzoxazine resin (V-fa) is subsequently copolymerized with epoxidized castor oil (ECO). When the copolymer is reinforced with multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs), the resulting composite exhibits shape memory effects. Molecular characteristics of V-fa resin, ECO, and V-fa/ECO copolymers are obtained from Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy. Curing behavior of V-fa/ECO copolymers is investigated by differential scanning calorimetry. Dynamic mechanical properties of MWCNT reinforced V-fa/ECO composites are determined by dynamic mechanical analysis. Morphological details and distribution of MWCNTs within the copolymer matrix are characterized by transmission electron microscopy. Shape memory performances of MWCNT reinforced V-fa/ECO composites are studied by shape memory tests performed with a universal testing machine. After a significant deformation to a temporary shape, the composites can be recovered to the original shape by near-infrared (NIR) laser actuation. The shape recovery process can be stimulated at a specific site of the composite simply by focusing NIR laser to that site. The shape recovery time of the composites under NIR actuation is four times faster than the shape recovery process under conventional thermal activation. Furthermore, the composites possess good shape fixity and good shape recovery under NIR actuation.', 'Effects of graphene nanoplatelets on bio-based shape memory polymers from benzoxazine/epoxy copolymers actuated by near-infrared light  The Author(s) 2021.Novel near-infrared (NIR) light-induced bio-based shape memory polymers (SMPs) were prepared from copolymers of vanillin/furfurylamine-based benzoxazine monomer (V-fa monomer) and epoxidized castor oil (ECO). Incorporation of graphene nanoplatelets (GNPs) as photothermal fillers into the copolymers provided shape memory properties under near-infrared (NIR) light actuation.

The uniform dispersion of 3 wt% GNPs in the V-fa/ECO copolymers resulted in the highest shape memory performance with shape fixity of 92% and shape recovery of 99% upon NIR light actuation. The recovery time decreased with the increment of GNP content, and the V-fa/ECO copolymers filled with GNPs displayed good execution in the repeated fold-deploy, in which the shape fixity and shape recovery values were close to the original specimen. Therefore, the outstanding properties of V-fa/ECO copolymers filled with GNPs had a potential to be excellent SMPs under NIR actuation.', 'Shape memory polymers from bio-based benzoxazine/epoxidized natural oil copolymers  2019 IOP Publishing Ltd.In this research, shape memory polymers (SMPs) fabricated from bio-based benzoxazine resins, i.e. vanillin-furfurylamine-containing benzoxazine (V-fa) and eugenol-furfurylamine-containing benzoxazine (E-fa) resins, and bio-based epoxy resin, i.e. epoxidized castor oil (ECO), are investigated.

Likewise, little work has been done to explore the transformative perspectives of both the children and the people around them. This study aims to explore a Culturally Relevant Constructionist Design framework that emphasizes making as a way of building connections to ones’ community. The participants’ shifting perspectives and receptivity in engaging in maker activities that involve making inventions for their community, inspired by the nation’s most beloved figure, King Bhumibol are evaluated. Design/methodology/approach: This study investigates fourth-grade students, a teacher and community members around a public school in Thailand. Using qualitative research methods, data collection includes interviews, field notes observation, photos and videos of the sessions. This paper presents three case studies that represent the shifting perspectives and receptivity of teachers, community members and students through engaging in making experience. The first case illustrates the ways in which building for others supports the students’ formation of an identity of a creator. The two cases describe a teacher and a community member who developed new-found perceptions of students as valuable contributors to the community. Findings: The findings highlight making inventions for the community as ways to connect teachers, community members and students together. The study also identifies key perceptions and experiences that empower students’ as contributors to their community. Through the process of making, the teacher and the community members also developed new-found positive perspectives of the students. Particularly, they viewed the students beyond traditional school performance metrics, and considered their other latent abilities. Practical implications: This study discusses these findings in light of previous research on maker education especially in low-income communities. It also showcases the role of making for the betterment of the community as a tool for engendering change in schools and empowering students to design and make personally and socially meaningful projects.

CsI crystals have been innovated for optical properties by applying techniques of Ca doping and multiple doping of Ca and Tl. As a reference; CsI:Tl crystal was also grown in the identical growth system. The crystal growth was processed under argon atmosphere in a quartz crucible. The composition of dopant was kept a constant of 0.35%wt. X-ray diffraction measurements show that CsI:Tl and CsI(Tl,Ca) crystals have the cubic crystal structure with a dominant (110) plane. But CsI:Ca crystal has two dominant planes of (110) and (211). In addition, photoluminescence (PL) measurements were performed to investigate their optical properties: CsI:Ca and CsI(Tl,Ca) crystals emitted the blue light in a range of 420-450 nm wavelength with two dominant peaks but the orange light emission of 590-nm wavelength from CsI:Tl crystal. To evaluate the efficiency and energy resolution of radiation detection by coupling these CsI scintillators with a photomultiplier tube, the results reveal their different radiation performances due to the main difference in their optical properties about the light emission characteristics. In conclusion, the radiation performance of CsI:Ca scintillator has been still challenge to accomplish with the optimized growth condition and the suitable coupling devices.', ""Effect of Bi2O3 on gamma ray shielding and structural properties of borosilicate glasses recycled from high pressure sodium lamp glass  2018 Elsevier B.V.The borosilicate glass was recycled from high pressure sodium lamp glass (HPSg) and investigated as a starting material for radiation shielding glass. Bi2O3 was expected to improve radiation shielding properties of the glass samples. Mass attenuation coefficients, effective atomic number (Zeff) and effective electron density (Ne) of the glass samples ((80 – x)HPSg – (20)Na2O – (x)Bi2O3 (x = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 mol%) were determined at different photon energies. The energy absorption buildup factor (EABF) and fast neutron removal cross sections were also calculated for the given materials. The results clearly revealed that mass attenuation coefficient and other parameters depends on concentration of Bi2O3 and addition of Bi2O3 significantly increased shielding capability of glass samples against gamma rays as well as fast neutrons. The results of Zeff and Ne confirmed the ability of shielding of the glass samples with Bi2O3 as well. Physical properties of glass samples were also investigated in the present work. The obtained ultrasonic velocities and Young's modulus of the glass samples led us to a conclusion that the network structures of the glass are loss of compact structures due to creation of NBOs when adding the Bi2O3. The FTIR measurements confirmed NBOs forming in the network structures of the glass samples with increase of Bi2O3 contents. The reported structural and radiation attenuation properties of recycled glass with Bi2O3 should be important in radiation shielding applications which requires high strength of structures at the same time."", 'Detecting and shielding properties of Ce3+-doped zinc–gadolinium-fluoroborate glasses for X-ray and proton radiation  2023 Elsevier B.V.Zinc-gadolinium-fluoroborate glasses doped with cerium fluoride (CeF3) were successfully fabricated to detect and shield X-ray and proton radiation. The doped glasses were studied at varying ZnO concentrations to investigate their properties, including density, transmittance, photoluminescence, and the oxidation states of dopants The glasses were tested for their sensitivity to detect X-ray and proton radiation, and calculations of the half-value layer and proton range were used to investigate their shielding properties. The results showed that an increase in ZnO concentrations induced a higher glass density and shifted the absorption edge to a longer wavelength (redshift) in the optical transmittance spectra. The cerium dopant mainly formed the Ce3+ oxidation state, resulting in a single broad band emission due to the 5d→4f transition of Ce3+ ions. The luminescence behavior of the doped glasses under x-ray irradiation showed a single broad emission at 375 nm. In contrast, under proton irradiation, the single broad emission shifted to a longer wavelength at 400 nm. The increase in ZnO concentration decreased light emission when exposed to x-rays and protons. The results also demonstrated that increasing ZnO concentrations improved the shielding properties of the glasses. We found that the glass with a 25 mol% ZnO concentration revealed a half-value layer of the 100 keV photon energy equal to 0.116 ± 0.001 cm, and a 70 MeV proton energy penetrated the maximum range in the glass at 1.308 ± 0.019 cm. We concluded that ZnO could be used to control the fraction between Ce3+ and Ce4+ ions in the cerium ions of the CeF3-doped glasses.']"

All rights reserved.Acid secretion inhibitors are usually prescribed to promote the healing of artificial ulcers caused by endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) to reduce the risk of gastric perforation and delayed bleeding. Vonoprazan is a newer agent that has been shown to be more potent than a proton-pump inhibitor (PPI). However, it remains unclear whether vonoprazan is more effective than PPI in promoting healing of ulcers caused by ESD. Medline and Embase databases were searched through January 2018 for studies that compared the rate of complete healing of ulcers caused by ESD and post-ESD delayed bleeding in patients who received vonoprazan versus those who received PPI after ESD. Pooled odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated using a random-effect model, generic inverse variance method. The between-study heterogeneity was quantified using the Q-statistic and I 2. A total of six studies consisting of 461 patients were identified. The likelihood that ulcers caused by ESD were completely healed at 4-8 weeks after the procedure was significantly higher among patients who received vonoprazan compared with those who received PPI, with a pooled OR of 2.27 (95% CI=1.38-3.73; I 2 =0%). The risk of developing post-ESD delayed bleeding was also numerically lower among those who received vonoprazan, with a pooled OR of 0.79, although the result did not reach statistical significance (95% CI=0.18-3.49; I 2 =29%).

All rights reserved.Background: The effectiveness of the hemostatic powder TC-325 as a single endoscopic treatment for acute nonvariceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding is uncertain. Objective: To compare TC-325 with standard endoscopic hemostatic treatments in the control of active bleeding from nonvariceal upper gastrointestinal causes. Design: One-sided, noninferiority, randomized, controlled trial. (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT02534571) Setting: University teaching hospitals in the Asia-Pacific region. Patients: 224 adult patients with acute bleeding from a nonvariceal cause on upper gastrointestinal endoscopy. Intervention: TC-325 (n = 111) or standard hemostatic treatment (n = 113). Measurements: The primary outcome was control of bleeding within 30 days. Other outcomes included failure to control bleeding during index endoscopy, recurrent bleeding after initial hemostasis, further interventions, blood transfusion, hospitalization, and death. Results: 224 patients were enrolled (136 with gastroduodenal ulcers [60.7%], 33 with tumors [14.7%], and 55 with other causes of bleeding [24.6%]). Bleeding was controlled within 30 days in 100 of 111 patients (90.1%) in the TC-325 group and 92 of 113 (81.4%) in the standard treatment group (risk difference, 8.7 percentage points [1-sided 95% CI, 0.95 percentage point]). There were fewer failures of hemostasis during index endoscopy with TC-325 (3 [2.7%] vs. 11 [9.7%]; odds ratio, 0.26 [CI, 0.07 to 0.95]). Recurrent bleeding within 30 days did not differ between groups (9 [8.1%] vs. 10 [8.8%]). The need for further interventions also did not differ between groups (further endoscopic treatment: 8 [7.2%] vs. 10 [8.8%]; angiography: 2 [1.8%] vs. 4 [3.5%]; surgery: 1 [0.9%] vs. 0). There were 14 deaths in each group (12.6% vs. 12.4%). Limitation: Clinicians were not blinded to treatment.

This study aimed to examine the efficacy of PPI alone versus combination treatment in healing of post-gastric ESD ulcers, as well as on delayed bleeding and amount of blood transfused. Methods: A systematic search of MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane, and ISI Web of knowledge databases, up until May 2017, for randomized trials comparing PPI alone versus PPI plus a mucoprotective drug in achieving ulcer healing in patients undergoing gastric ESD was performed. The primary outcome is scarring stage on endoscopic assessment at 4 or 8 weeks after gastric ESD. Results: From an initial 3071 citations, eight articles (n = 953 lesions from 934 patients) were analyzed. Patients receiving combination treatment achieved a scarring stage significantly more often than those on a PPIs alone at 4 or 8 weeks after ESD, (risk ratio = 1.36, 95% CI; 1.06–1.75). No study reported amount of blood transfused. There were no significant between treatment-group differences in terms of delayed bleeding (risk ratio = 0.58, 95% CI; 0.17–1.99). Neither location of ulcer nor Helicobacter pylori infection was related to ulcer scarring stage. Conclusion: The limited evidences suggested combination treatment may be more effective in accelerating the process of ulcer healing in patients undergoing gastric ESD than the use of PPI alone, but does not appear to alter delayed bleeding risk.']"

Materials and methods: Orthodontic brackets with artificial demineralized enamel slabs were attached to the upper first molars of 12 participants. A set of 3 test specimens from the same tooth was randomly assigned to each participant and allocated into three 30-day sessions: 1) brushing with 0.22% NaF dentifrice 2 times/day (F dentifrice), 2) brushing with 0.22% NaF dentifrice 2 times/day+ rinsing with 0.05% NaF before bedtime (F mouth rinse), 3) brushing with 0.22% NaF dentifrice 2 times/day + brushing with 1.1% NaF gel before bedtime (F brush-on gel).

Materials and methods: 81 human enamel specimens were embedded in resin blocks and divided into nine groups as follows; group 1: stannous fluoride (1000SnF2) toothpaste; groups 2,3, and 4 were the same as group 1 plus Elmex®, PerioMed™, and Meridol®, respectively, group 5: stannous fluoride (1450SnF2) toothpaste, groups 6, 7, and 8 were the same as group 5 plus Elmex®, PerioMed™, and Meridol®, respectively, group 9: negative control. An erosive challenge was induced with a 1 min hydrochloric acid (0.01 M, pH 2.2) treatment 3 times per day. Each cycle included immersing in the toothpaste slurry twice for two minutes and a one-minute rinse. The enamel slabs were immersed in artificial saliva between each erosive cycle and incubated overnight at 37 °C. Surface hardness loss and enamel loss were determined by Knoop surface hardness and non-contact profilometry, respectively. Finally, enamel surfaces were analyzed by scanning electron microscopy and X-ray energy dispersive spectroscopy (SEM/EDS). Results: All three mouth rinses had similar protective effects against erosion when using adjunct with 1000 SnF2 toothpaste (p > 0.05). With 1450 SnF2 toothpaste, Elmex® presented significantly lower surface hardness loss than Meridol® (p < 0.05). The combined use of Elmex® or PerioMed™ with toothpaste provided significantly better erosion protection than toothpaste alone, either 1000 or 1450 SnF2. In addition, 1000SnF2 toothpaste adjunct with mouth rinse is comparable to 1450 SnF2 toothpaste alone in preventing enamel erosion. Conclusion: All three mouth rinses reduced enamel erosion. The additional use of a high concentration stannous containing mouth rinse with 1450 SnF2 toothpaste increases the protective effect against enamel erosion in vitro. Clinical significance: To date, no standard protocol for preventing dental erosion is available.

Methods Eighteen artificial caries slabs were created from the proximal surfaces of nine chemically demineralized premolars. The slabs were scanned by Micro-Computed Tomography (Micro-CT) to determine the baseline mineral density of the initial lesions and randomly allocated into 2 groups. The test group was applied with 38% SDF in adjunct to fluoride toothpaste and the control group was treated with fluoride toothpaste alone. The specimens underwent bacterial pH-cycling for 5 d and were re-evaluated using Micro-CT. The pre-treatment and post-treatment mineral densities were plotted and the areas under the curves were used to calculate the remineralization percentage of both groups. Results Mineral density significantly increased in both groups after pH-cycling (p < 0.05) although to different depths (control group = 260 μm, test group = 300 μm). The test group demonstrated a significantly higher mineral density to a depth of 120 μm and higher remineralization percentage (p < 0.05) compared with the control group. Conclusion The adjunctive use of 38% SDF enhances the remineralization of initial carious lesions based on mineral density, depth, and remineralization percentage compared with the use of 1000 ppm fluoride toothpaste alone. SDF might be used as an adjunct to fluoride toothpaste to remineralize incipient caries lesions on smooth tooth surfaces. Clinical significance In non-compliant patients, the application of 38% SDF might be used as an adjunct to fluoride toothpaste, to remineralize incipient caries lesions of permanent teeth where esthetics is not a concern.']"

As such, groundwater resources are an additional freshwater source in this region, in particular for cultivating activities. Thus, an understanding of the volume of groundwater recharge into the saturated zone is required. The objective of the study is to assess the groundwater recharge potential (GRP) using the weighted overlay analysis method by geographic information system (GIS) and finally checking the reliability of GRP map using observed specific capacity carried out by the Department of Groundwater Resources (DGR). The geological and hydrogeological features that affect groundwater potential are the lithology, land use, lineaments, drainage, slope, and soil. The weighting and rating of these six influencing factors were determined by assessing the interrelationship of the main and minor influences of each factor based on several literature reviews, followed by a weighted overlay analysis with GIS, in association with groundwater recharge. The GRP can be classified in descending order: high, moderate, low, and very low, where about 33.9 km2 (2.26% of the total area of 1,500 km2) had high recharge potentiality, located at the center of the area. Only 12.8% of the total precipitation (271.75 million m3/y or approximately 181.2 mm) infiltrated the groundwater aquifer, while the rest was lost by either surface runoff or evapotranspiration. Based on GRP sensitivity analysis index, lithology was the most efficient influencing factor in GRP mapping. Most groundwater wells (>96% or 369 wells) were classified into the classes of low and moderated, which agree to the GRP zones. The results of calculating the area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve were 86.0 percent, with relatively good predictive accuracy. The stable baseflow analysis would be used to confirm the amount of GRP by weighting overlay technique. Therefore, the GRP method can be applied in other areas, particular in similar hydrogeological characteristics. The first-hand recharge potential map and groundwater recharge information in this area can be used to establish an effective groundwater exploration program for agricultural activities; it is also used to appropriate sustainable yields from each groundwater basin to provide groundwater over the long-term, without negatively impacting the environment and without affecting the groundwater balance as it has recharge in the rainy seasons, which can use groundwater sustainably. It is in line with the sustainable development goals (SDGs) in goal number six of the UN.', 'Groundwater and river interaction impact to aquifer system in saigon river basin, vietnam  2020, Chulalongkorn University, Faculty of Fine and Applied Arts. All rights reserved.Since the 1990s, under the pressure of socio-economic growth in the Ho Chi Minh City and nearby provinces, the heavy-extraction of groundwater of this area has dramatically increased to meet high water demand for domestic and industrial purposes. Although the groundwater – Saigon River interaction significantly contributes to groundwater reserves, researchers have been less attentive to fully describe and understand the river recharge. This study attempts to explore the impact of groundwater-river interaction to aquifer system due to pumping increase via field seepage and (O18, H2) isotopic measurements in the Saigon River Basin, South East of Vietnam. The analysis showed that river bed conductance at 0 km, 30 km, 60 km, 80 km, and 120 km were 4.5 m2/day/m, 4.2 m2/day/m, 2.5 m2/day/m, 1.7 m2/day/m, and 0.25 m2/day/m respectively. The riverbed conductance relies on the sand percentage of sediment. The composition δO18 in groundwater, river, and precipitation indicates that river recharge to groundwater exists mainly in the lower part of the basin. In contrast to downstream, the composition of δO18 was signified that the river primarily gains water from groundwater upstream. Under pressure of developing economies, the groundwater pumping in the Saigon river basin increased from 175,000 m3/day in 1995 to 880,000 m3/day in 2017. As a consequence of the increased pumping rate, the groundwater discharge to the river decreases from 1.6 to 0.7 times of groundwater pumping in upstream, while the amount of Saigon river recharge increases by 33% to 50% of the total groundwater pumping downstream. Under the exceedance pumping rate, the aquifers in the Saigon River Basin release less water to the Saigon river and it tends to gain more water through the river-groundwater interaction process. Therefore, groundwater management in downstream aquifers needs better joint planning with surface water development plans, particularly for surface water supply utilities which still struggle to satisfy the water demand of the development plan.', 'Prediction of groundwater table depth using direct rainfall-groundwater statistical correlations in Thailand  2006 Institute of Research and Development, Suranaree University of Technology.Intensive water resources development in past decades has had large impacts on hydrogeological systems at basin-scales.

The monthly rainfall and groundwater data sets from several rain gauge and piezometric stations in the study areas for the period 2007- 2008 were collected from the Royal Irrigation Department, Thai Meteorological Department, and Department of Groundwater Resources (Thailand). It was initially hypothesized (and later on confirmed) that the groundwater table depth of the previous period was due to the slower movement of groundwater through recharge and infiltration processes. The multiple linear correlation analysis has been carried out to study the influence of rainfall, antecedent rainfall, and antecedent groundwater table depth on groundwater depth. The influencing variables have been selected based on the measures of multiple linear correlations. Because the groundwater database is not frequently updated compared to the precipitation and surface water database, the relationships proposed herein may be adopted to predict groundwater table depths to a reasonable degree of accuracy for better planning and management of groundwater resources of the basin.']"

Dynamic Time Warping and Longest Common Subsequence are well-known and widely used algorithms to measure similarity between two time series sequences using non-linear alignment. However, these algorithms work at its best when the time series pair has similar amplitude scaling, as a little adjustment of scale can actually double the error rates. Unfortunately, sensor data and most real-world time series data usually contain noise, missing values, outlier, and variability or scaling in both axes, which is not suitable for the widely used Z-normalization. We introduce the Local Feature Normalization (LFN) and its Local Scaling Feature (LSF), which can be used to robustly normalize noisy/warped/missing-valued time series. In addition, we utilize LSF to match time series containing multiple subsequences with a variety of scales; this algorithm is called Longest Common Local Scaling Feature (LCSF). Comparing to the usage of Z-normalized data, our classification results show that our proposed LFN is impressively robust, especially on high-error and noisy datasets. On both synthetic and real application data for wrist strengthening rehabilitation exercise using a mobile phone sensor, our LCSF similarity measure also significantly outperforms other existing methods by a large margin.', 'A dimensionality reduction technique for time series classification using additive representation  Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2019.Time series classification has become one of the most prevalent time series mining tasks. There has also been extensively demonstrated in a variety of domains that other non-time series data can also be transformed into time series data. However, time series data are often large and occasionally contain noise and outliers. Therefore, there have been numerous efforts to resolve the problem by reducing the dimensionality of the data or coming up with new data representations. In this work, we propose a very simple approach to reduce the dimensionality of the data and to significantly speed up time series classification without sacrificing classification accuracy. Our experiment results show that our new additive representation could achieve better classification accuracy in most datasets when compared to the popular SAX symbolic representation and also has better accuracy in more than half of the datasets when compared with the full dataset classification. Our proposed representation also has higher average compression ratio that of SAX, giving our representation a competitive choice when dimensionality reduction is needed.', 'An enhanced time series motif discovery using approximated matrix profile  2020 ACM.Motif discovery of time series data is one of the most prevalent data mining tasks in finding repeated patterns that contain important information in a time series sequence. In particular, its purpose is to find the most similar non-overlapping subsequences pair(s). Recent methods have adopted a matrix profile as a novel data structure for motif discovery problem. However, their ) time complexity is considered exceedingly high especially for massive time series data. In this paper, we propose a simple dimensionality reduction method as well as an enhanced approximated matrix profile structure to speed up motif discovery task in massive time series data. As large parts of the matrix profile and raw time series sequences are omitted, our experiments on both synthetic and real datasets demonstrate that we could substantially outperform other rival methods in terms of computation time while maintaining high accuracy of the motif discovery results.']"

There are in general four electric-magnetic phases corresponding to each SO(3) factor, but two phases of the SO(3) factors embedded in the SO(6) R-symmetry are fixed. One phase can be set to zero by SL(2,R) transformations. The second one gives equivalent theories for any nonvanishing values and can be set to π2 resulting in gauged supergravities that admit N=4 supersymmetric AdS4 vacua. The remaining two phases are truly deformation parameters leading to different SO(4)×SO(4) gauged supergravities. As in the ω-deformed SO(8) maximal gauged supergravity, the cosmological constant and scalar masses of the AdS4 vacuum at the origin of the scalar manifold with SO(4)×SO(4) symmetry do not depend on the electric-magnetic phases. We find N=1 holographic RG flow solutions between N=4 critical points with SO(4)×SO(4) and SO(3)diag×SO(3)×SO(3) or SO(3)×SO(3)diag×SO(3) symmetries. We also give N=2 and N=1 RG flows from these critical points to various nonconformal phases.

In N= 3 theory, we consider N= 3 gauged supergravity coupled to three vector multiplets and SO(3) × SO(3) gauge group. The resulting gauged supergravity admits two N= 3 supersymmetric AdS4 vacua with SO(3) × SO(3) and SO(3) symmetries.

These AdS4 vacua correspond to N= 4 SCFTs in three dimensions with SO(4) R-symmetry and different flavor symmetries. We explicitly compute the full scalar mass spectra at all these vacua. Holographic RG flows interpolating between these conformal fixed points are also given. The solutions describe supersymmetric deformations of N= 4 SCFTs by relevant operators of dimensions Δ = 1 , 2. A number of these solutions can be found analytically although some of them can only be obtained numerically. These results provide a rich and novel class of N= 4 fixed points in three-dimensional Chern–Simons-Matter theories and possible RG flows between them in the framework of N= 4 gauged supergravity in four dimensions.

The selected based-clays were plate-like kaolinite (Kaol; 1:1 aluminum phyllosilicate), globular montmorillonite (Mt; 2:1 aluminum phyllosilicate), globular bentonite (Bent; 2:1 aluminum phyllosilicate), and fibrous sepiolite (Sep; 2:1 inverted ribbons of magnesium phyllosilicate). The clay/AuNPs were synthesized using in situ chemical reduction of the gold precursor with anchoring 3-aminopropyl triethoxysilane (APTES) on the clay surfaces. The studied materials were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), nitrogen adsorption/desorption, Fourier transformed infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA), zeta-potential analysis, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). Surface area, surface charges, and hydrophilic/hydrophobic nature of based-clays and the clay/AuNPs played major roles on AChE loading, residual activity, and sensor storage stability. The Mt/AuNPs was determined, among the studied clays, as the best supports for AChE loading and residual activities due to its high specific surface area and weak electrostatic interaction with the immobilized enzyme. Since apparent catalytic efficiencies kcat app/KM appof the immobilized AChE in the four clay/AuNPs were found statistically similar, Mt/AuNPs which contained the highest enzyme loading was the favorite modified-electrode material. For chlorpyrifos detection, Kaol/AuNPs-based sensors resulted in the lowest detection limit, presumably due to the strong hydrophobic surface that helps to concentrate the nonpolar pesticide to the vicinity of the immobilized enzyme. Unfortunately, the highest electrostatic repulsion between the Kaol/AuNPs and AChE, and the dehydrated Kaol surface resulted in the lowest storage stability of the AChE pesticide sensors. Overall, Mt/AuNPs showed the highest potential as the AChE carrier and the modified electrode material for chlorpyrifos determination.', 'Copper Oxide Nanorods Pesticide Sensor for Methyl Parathion Detection  2019 IEEE.Currently, most electrochemical based pesticide sensors use acetylcholinesterase enzyme modifying on working electrode surface to sense the concentration of the organophosphate pesticides. Since this method has high sensitivity and easy to prepare; however the cost of the enzyme is very expensive and the stability of the enzyme activity is poor which result in short lifetime. From those drawbacks of current pesticide sensor, non-enzymatic sensor is an alternative way to detect pesticide with lower cost, higher sensitivity and stability. In this work, copper oxide nanorods were used to overcome the difficulties of enzymatic pesticide sensor. To obtain cost effective and simple preparation pesticide sensor, direct anodization and annealing processes were used to synthesize copper oxide nanorods. We used our synthesized copper oxide nanorods in electrochemical analysis by performing cyclic voltammetry in organophosphate pesticide. Our copper oxide nanorods electrode exhibits sensitivity and detection limit of 1.234 μA/ng mL-1 and 0.0761 ng/mL, respectively.

All rights reserved.This work aims at evaluating a utilization of diverse clay mineral/gold nanoparticles/acetylcholinesterase (clay/AuNPs/AChE) biosensors by using principal component analysis (PCA) for the discrimination of pesticide types and their concentration levels both in the synthetic and real samples. Applications of simple and low-cost clay/AuNP composites of different characteristics as modified-electrode materials are highlighted. Four types of clay minerals, namely, platelike kaolinite (Kaol: 1:1 aluminum phyllosilicate), globular montmorillonite (Mt: 2:1 aluminum phyllosilicate), globular bentonite (Bent: 2:1 aluminum phyllosilicate), and fibrous sepiolite (Sep: 2:1 inverted ribbons of magnesium phyllosilicate), were selected as the base materials. Due to the distinct characteristics of the selected clay, the derived clay/AuNP composites resulted in different physical morphologies, AuNP sizes and loadings, matrix hydrophobicity, and active AChE loading per electrode. These, in turn, caused divergent electrochemical responses for the pesticide determination; hence, no other enzymes apart from AChE were necessary for the fabrication of distinct biosensors. Physical and chemical characterizations of clay/AuNPs were conducted using scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, thermogravimetric analysis, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy techniques. The electrochemical information was recorded by cyclic voltammetry and amperometry techniques. The enzyme inhibition results obtained from the pesticides were treated and used as input data to obtain PCA results. The four fabricated clay/AuNPs/AChE biosensors were able to discriminate chlorpyrifos and carbaryl and their concentration levels for synthetic pesticides and real samples. It was disclosed that a high enzyme inhibition and a high hydrophobic modified-electrode material affect a highly sensitive pesticide biosensor. The hydrophobic/hydrophilic character of the modified-electrode material plays a major role in discriminating the pesticide types and their concentration levels by the proposed single-enzyme sensor system. The PCA results illustrated that PC2 described the different types of pesticides, and PC1 showed the level of pesticide concentration with high first two principal components. The mixed pesticides could be identified at an especially low total concentration of 0.5 ng/mL in real samples.']"

Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.Hyposalivation and severe dry mouth syndrome are the most common complications in patients with head and neck cancer (HNC) after receiving radiation therapy. Conventional treatment for hyposalivation relies on the use of sialogogues such as pilocarpine; however, their efficacy is constrained by the limited number of remnant acinar cells after radiation. After radiotherapy, the salivary gland (SG) secretory parenchyma is largely destroyed, and due to the reduced stem cell niche, this gland has poor regenerative potential. To tackle this, researchers must be able to generate highly complex cellularized 3D constructs for clinical transplantation via technologies, including those that involve bioprinting of cells and biomaterials. A potential stem cell source with promising clinical outcomes to reserve dry mouth is adipose mesenchymal stem cells (AdMSC). MSC-like cells like human dental pulp stem cells (hDPSC) have been tested in novel magnetic bioprinting platforms using nanoparticles that can bind cell membranes by electrostatic interaction, as well as their paracrine signals arising from extracellular vesicles. Both magnetized cells and their secretome cues were found to increase epithelial and neuronal growth of in vitro and ex vivo irradiated SG models. Interestingly, these magnetic bioprinting platforms can be applied as a high-throughput drug screening system due to the consistency in structure and functions of their organoids. Recently, exogenous decellularized porcine ECM was added to this magnetic platform to stimulate an ideal environment for cell tethering, proliferation, and/or differentiation. The combination of these SG tissue biofabrication strategies will promptly allow for in vitro organoid formation and establishment of cellular senescent organoids for aging models, but challenges remain in terms of epithelial polarization and lumen formation for unidirectional fluid flow. Current magnetic bioprinting nanotechnologies can provide promising functional and aging features to in vitro craniofacial exocrine gland organoids, which can be utilized for novel drug discovery and/or clinical transplantation.', 'Trends in Salivary Gland Tissue Engineering: From Stem Cells to Secretome and Organoid Bioprinting  Copyright 2021, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers 2021.Xerostomia or dry mouth are commonly diagnosed in head and neck cancer patients due to salivary gland (SG) epithelial injury after radiotherapy. Regenerative medicine has fetched the opportunity to replace or regenerate the SG epithelia and restore its secretory function. Early adult stem cell transplantation strategies in rodents have recently shown to improve clinical outcomes in radiotherapy-induced xerostomia in Phase 1/2 human trials. Mesenchymal stem cells from adipose tissue are the most promising, although the ones from the labial mucosa, bone marrow, or dental pulp have an attractive therapeutic value after successful findings in ex vivo and in vivo mouse models of SG injury. Emerging approaches using cell-free therapy with cell ""extracts"", ""soups""or secretome components also exhibit favorable outcomes in the same rodent models. When compared to cell-based approaches, extracellular vesicles (EV) from the secretome (i.e., exosomes) can be easily extracted, quantified, and are more stable for long-term storage and use in SG tissue engineering. Additive manufacturing and three-dimensional bioprinting or bioassembly have an important role on generating spheroids or organoids for cell transplantation to ameliorate SG injury. Moreover, organoids can secrete EV, which may have a therapeutic potential worth to explore in future studies. In this review, we will describe the technological advancements and challenges of these different cell-based and cell-free strategies in SG tissue engineering and regeneration. Salivary gland (SG)-like innervated epithelial organoids and the secretome produced from stem cells may constitute feasible therapeutic alternatives to regenerate the SG due to their user-friendly, short-lived, consistent, and scalable additive manufacturing processes. Bioprinting such human SG organoids toward in vitro drug discovery may further reduce the incorporation of animal-derived components to the tissue constructs and minimize the use of animal experimentation in SG regeneration. Despite such advancements, transplantation with human adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells is the only tissue engineering strategy that has reached Phase 1/2 clinical trials and shown to enlarge the serous SG epithelium and improve salivary flow.', 'Engineering innervated secretory epithelial organoids by magnetic three-dimensional bioprinting for stimulating epithelial growth in salivary glands  2018 Elsevier LtdCurrent saliva-based stimulation therapies for radiotherapy-induced xerostomia are not fully effective due to the presence of damaged secretory epithelia and nerves in the salivary gland (SG). Hence, three-dimensional bio-engineered organoids are essential to regenerate the damaged SG. Herein, a recently validated three-dimensional (3D) biofabrication system, the magnetic 3D bioprinting (M3DB), is tested to generate innervated secretory epithelial organoids from a neural crest-derived mesenchymal stem cell, the human dental pulp stem cell (hDPSC). Cells are tagged with magnetic nanoparticles (MNP) and spatially arranged with magnet dots to generate 3D spheroids. Next, a SG epithelial differentiation stage was completed with fibroblast growth factor 10 (4–400 ng/ml) to recapitulate SG epithelial morphogenesis and neurogenesis. The SG organoids were then transplanted into ex vivo model to evaluate their epithelial growth and innervation. M3DB-formed spheroids exhibited both high cell viability rate (>90%) and stable ATP intracellular activity compared to MNP-free spheroids. After differentiation, spheroids expressed SG epithelial compartments including secretory epithelial, ductal, myoepithelial, and neuronal. Fabricated organoids also produced salivary α-amylase upon FGF10 stimulation, and intracellular calcium mobilization and trans-epithelial resistance was elicited upon neurostimulation with different neurotransmitters. After transplantation, the SG-like organoids significantly stimulated epithelial and neuronal growth in damaged SG. It is the first time bio-functional innervated SG-like organoids are bioprinted. Thus, this is an important step towards SG regeneration and the treatment of radiotherapy-induced xerostomia.']"

Plants grown in the presence of either NTA or EDTA-NTA mixtures showed significant lower Cd accumulation levels. The LA-ICP-MS analysis showed that Cd was primarily accumulated in the aboveground part (stems and leaves), especially in the xylem and intercalary meristem.

Plants were analyzed with AAS and LA-ICP-MS every 15 days over a total of 45 days. A Cd concentration of 40 mg/L was used to test the mixtures of Cd and EDTA. A 1:2 molar ratio of Cd and EDTA was found to be the most appropriate for phytoremediation. The plants showed effective growth, low phytotoxicity, and a high accumulation of Cd.

LA-ICP-MS analysis showed that Cd accumulation was highest in the underground parts of plants. This result was in accordance with the quantitative data from the AAS. Therefore, it can be concluded that plants mostly accumulate Cd in their underground parts, especially with added EDTA (1:2 mol at 105 days). LA-ICP-MS can be used to conclude with certainty that EDTA is an important factor for effectively inducing Cd into the root system.']"

The addition of NaCl resulted in the two-step hydrate formation, and it is the first stage that adversely affected the hydrate formation rate. However, the final gas uptake in this system was similar to that without NaCl. The synergistic effects on the kinetic promotion by adding a co-promoter including sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) and amino acids (valine, leucine, and methionine) were then studied. The results showed that the addition of the co-promoters reduced the induction time, minimized the length of the first stage formation, and increased the hydrate formation rate. Moreover, the induction time and the length of the first stage formation decreased along with the increase in the co-promoter concentration. However, the addition of SDS had the adverse effects by decreasing about half of the final gas uptake and the water to hydrate conversion for the system without SDS. Moreover, the addition of methionine resulted in the best performance as a kinetic promoter on the hydrate formation in the system with THF and NaCl. Up to 95 % of methane gas can be recovered from the hydrates formed with and without the co-promoters.

This work investigated the morphology of mixed methane–THF hydrate formation using salt water (3.5 wt % NaCl) instead of pure water at 288.2 K and 8 MPa. The result indicated that the nucleation occurred at the gas/liquid interface and then the hydrates grew along the wall of the crystallizer column. After a specific time interval, the hydrates gradually grew downward until they completely covered the bulk solution. This work applied 500 ppm of co-promoters, including sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) and three amino acids─valine, leucine, and methionine to improve the kinetics of mixed hydrate formation. The presence of SDS in the system resulted in distinct mixed hydrate formation patterns. After hydrate nucleation at the gas/liquid interface, most of the hydrates predominantly grew downward and enveloped the solution within a few minutes. Moreover, the mushy hydrates gradually transformed into stiff hydrates over time. Three amino acids resulted in the same hydrate patterns as those formed in the absence of a co-promoter, but the formation was completed more rapidly. The kinetic data indicated that using salt water for the formation of mixed methane–THF hydrates resulted in low hydrate formation kinetics. The presence of SDS significantly enhanced the kinetics of hydrate formation but decreased the final gas uptake by about one-half. Additionally, it was discovered that the presence of amino acids accelerated the hydrate formation kinetics while having a negligible effect on the final methane uptake.', 'Improvement of Methane Hydrate Formation Using Biofriendly Amino Acids for Natural Gas Storage Applications: Kinetic and Morphology Insights  2022 American Chemical Society.

However, it has some limitations, particularly the slow rate of hydrate formation and the requirement for severe operating conditions. To overcome these constraints, one approach is to introduce promoters into the system to enhance the hydrate formation rate. Amino acids have been reported as kinetic promoters with the potential to improve the methane hydrate formation. In this work, the effect of three different side-chain amino acids (l-methionine, l-leucine, and l-valine) on methane hydrate formation and dissociation was investigated in terms of kinetics and morphology. The experiments were conducted at 8 MPa and 277.2 K using a hybrid combinatorial reactor approach at various amino acid concentrations (0.10 to 1.00). The results showed that the presence of amino acids significantly decreased the induction time and increased the rate of methane hydrate formation. In addition, l-methionine was shown to be the most effective as a kinetic promoter in this work. However, the final methane uptake and the water to hydrate conversion were the same in all experiments. For all the investigated experiments, the morphology of methane hydrate formation exhibited a similar pattern, including methane bubbles and capillary channels. In terms of hydrate dissociation, methane recovery was greater than 95% in all studies, and no foam was generated during hydrate dissociation, which is favorable for large-scale applications.']"

To overcome the substandard mechanical properties of recycled brick aggregate concrete (RBAC), specimens were strengthened with 2, 4, and 6 layers of LC‐GFRP sheets. Noticeable improvements in ultimate compressive stress and corresponding strain were observed and were found to correlate positively with the number of LC‐GFRP sheets. It was found that 4 and 6 layers of LC‐ GFRP sheets imparted significant axial ductility irrespective of the brick aggregate type and inherent concrete strength. Several existing stress‐strain models for confined concrete were considered to predict ultimate confined compressive stress and corresponding strain. Accuracy of existing models was assessed by mean of the ratio of analytical to experimental values and associated standard deviations. For ultimate stress predictions, the lowest mean value of the ratio of analytical to experimental ultimate compressive stress was 1.07 with a standard deviation of 0.10. However, none of the considered models was able to provide good estimates of ultimate strains.', 'Sustainable and Low-Cost Hemp FRP Composite Confinement of B-Waste Concrete  2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.Each year, massive amount of construction waste is generated that needs proper attention in terms of its disposal without deteriorating surrounding environment. A significant portion of this waste comprises bricks. Besides, large number of new construction works are resulting in the depletion of natural resources rapidly. Intuitively, a sustainable solution demands to consume this construction waste in the best way possible. This study targeted brick waste as a potential material to be used as a partial replacement of natural aggregates in structural concrete. It has been known that the concrete constructed with recycled brick aggregates possesses substandard mechanical properties. Traditionally, synthetic FRPs are known to strengthen recycled aggregate concrete. However, recognizing high costs associated with them, this study proposed the use of natural hemp fiber ropes to strengthen recycled aggregate concrete constructed with brick aggregates. To assess the efficacy of hemp ropes in strengthening mechanical properties of the concrete with coarse aggregates partially replaced with recycled brick aggregates (B-waste), an experimental framework was conducted. Sixteen cylindrical specimens were tested in two groups depending upon the concrete strength. Within each group, 2 specimens each were strengthened with 1, 2, and 3 layers of hemp fiber ropes. Axial monotonic compressive loading was applied to each specimen. Results revealed that hemp fiber ropes significantly improved ultimate compressive strength and the corresponding strain. A substantial improvement in axial ductility was observed. For the sake of perfor-mance-based non-linear modelling, accurate constitutive modelling at material level is necessary. For this purpose, several existing analytical stress-strain models were tested in this study to predict ultimate confined compressive strength and strain. It was found that several models predicted confined compressive strengths with reasonable accuracy. However, very few models were able to predict confined peak strain with good accuracy.', 'Behavior of concrete confined with epoxy bonded fiber ropes under axial load  2020 Elsevier LtdIn the past, several experimental and theoretical studies investigated the axial compressive strength and strain of plain concrete (PC) externally confined with natural and synthetic fiber reinforced polymer (FRP) composites. Typical types of synthetic FRP(s) are aramid, glass, carbon, PEN (polyethylene naphthalates) and PET (polyethylene terephthalate), whereas natural FRP(s) include flax, sisal, hemp and jute. In this article, the performance of a novel, low-cost and sustainable strengthening technique i.e., fiber rope reinforced polymer (FRRP) composites to enhance the axial compressive strength, strain and deformability of concrete specimens through external wrapping is explored. The outstanding benefits of the newly proposed FRRP composites are low-cost, wide availability, easy application and more environmentally friendly. In this research, 39 circular plain concrete (PC) cylinders were tested to failure under uniaxial compression. The research parameters covered fiber rope type (such as hemp, cotton and polyester) and number of FRRP layers. Experimental results proved that external confinement by using FRRP is very effective to enhance ultimate strength, strain and deformability of the concrete. Further, based on the test results, the implementation of the existing ultimate compressive strength and strain models established for the synthetic and natural FRP(s) is evaluated to assess their application to the newly proposed FRRP confinement. It is found that more or less all considered models do not accurately predict the tested ultimate compressive strength and strain of the FRRP-confined concrete. In the end, new ultimate strength and strain models are proposed to accurately predict the ultimate compressive strength and strain of concrete specimens confined with fiber rope reinforced polymer composites. The predicted ultimate compressive strength and strain values compare favorably with the experimental results of the present study.']"

Cephalometric analysis is a relationship of human geometry which can be quantified and derived from the linear and angular measurements. To treat any patient, such analysis is required to be performed on the Head X-ray image of the patient. The objective of the proposed work is to detect cephalometric landmarks automatically on CT (computational tomography) images. Twenty cephalometric landmarks were automatically localized on 100 CT scans using hybrid coarse-to-fine computational method.

Materials and methods: Pretreatment lateral cephalometric radiographs of 418 growing orthodontic patients (183 males, 235 females); 6–20 years old (mean age, 13.95 ± 3.62 years), were collected from 2007–2014, Department of Radiology, Faculty of Dentistry, and divided into 3 skeletal ages according to cervical vertebral maturation stages, pre-pubertal (cervical stages (CS) 1,2), pubertal (CS 3,4), and post-pubertal (CS 5,6). Ten angular, 13 linear, and 3 cephalometric area measurements were analyzed. Three-way ANOVA and Factor analysis were applied to compare sex, skeletal age, and sagittal skeletal pattern differences in the pharyngeal airway dimensions and the surrounding structure dimensions and positions. Results: Sex–skeletal age interactions existed in the nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal airway dimensions, and dimensions and positions (vertical, horizontal) of surrounding structures. Skeletal age–sagittal skeletal pattern interactions also affected the pharyngeal airway dimensions. In the post-pubertal period, male and skeletal Class III subjects tended to have larger pharyngeal airway, tongue, and soft palate dimensions; more anterior positions of the hyoid and tongue; and less obtuse soft palate angulation. The post-pubertal males also had more inferior positions of the hyoid and tongue.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Japanese males with skeletal Class III (ANB < 0°) and Class I skeletal anatomy (0.62° < ANB < 5.94°) were recruited (n = 18/group). Acoustic analysis of vowel sounds and cephalometric analysis of lateral cephalograms were performed. For sound analysis, an isolated Japanese vowel (/a/,/i/,/u/,/e/,/o/) pattern was recorded. Praat software was used to extract acoustic parameters such as fundamental frequency (F0) and the first four formants (F1, F2, F3, and F4). The formant graph area was calculated. Cephalometric values were obtained using ImageJ. Correlations between acoustic and cephalometric variables in skeletal Class III subjects were then investigated. RESULTS: Skeletal Class III subjects exhibited significantly higher/o/F2 and lower/o/F4 values. Mandibular length, SNB, and overjet of Class III subjects were moderately negatively correlated with acoustic variables. LIMITATIONS: This study did not take into account vertical skeletal patterns and tissue movements during sound production. CONCLUSION: Skeletal Class III males produced different /o/ (back and rounded vowel), possibly owing to their anatomical positions or adaptive changes. Vowel production was moderately associated with cephalometric characteristics of Class III subjects. Thus, changes in speech after orthognathic surgery may be expected. A multidisciplinary team approach that included the input of a speech pathologist would be useful.']"

The elemental composition, phase structure, and morphology of the FB powder were investigated and compared with commercial hydroxyapatite powder (SM powder). The FB-powder exhibited 1.01 at. % of Mg while the SM-powder showed Mg in ppm-level. Carbonate groups were detected in the two powders. Both HAp and β-tricalcium phosphate (β-TCP) structures were found in the FB powder, but the SM powder exhibit only the HAp phase. Irregular-shaped particles were observed in the FB powder. After the two HAp powders were sintered at 1200 °C and 1250 °C for 2 h (FB-1200, FB-1250, SM-1200, and SM-1250), the β-TCP intensity peaks of the FB-ceramic samples significantly increased with increasing sintering temperature. The highest relative density, well-packed grains, and β-TCP stabilization by Mg at the Ca5 site of the FB-1250 structure were the dominant factors governing the highest mechanical properties. Although high density was observed in the SM-1200 sample, Vickers hardness of the SM-1200 sample is lower than the FB-1250 sample. This may be attributed to the partial decomposition of HAp into β-TCP, α-tricalcium phosphate (α-TCP), and Ca10(PO4)6O phases.

The HAp was produced by a sintering temperature of 900 °C. Furthermore, HAp sintered at 900 °C was subjected to sintering temperatures of 1000 and 1100 °C.The structural and morphological evolution of the fabricated biomaterials were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) equipped with electron dispersive X-ray analysis (EDX) respectively. Uniaxial compaction using a pressure of 500 pa was used to produce rectangular shaped pellets to investigate the influence of sintering temperature on the mechanical properties of the produced pellets. From XRD analysis, it was found that hydroxyapatite derived from the biowastes showed good thermal stability and did not exhibit phase instability with traces of other calcium phosphates. The SEM micrographs showed microporous structure of the biomaterials and an increase in temperature reduced the porosity and enhanced the mechanical properties. It was also noticed that the trend of transformation of the average shape of pores was from strongly flattened to round at higher sintering temperatures. Electron dispersive X-ray analysis (EDX) revealed that the atomic Ca/P ratios of the as-sintered HAp specimens ranged from 1.58 to 1.79 for sintering temperatures of 900–1100 °C. The synthesized hydroxyapatite powder showed inclusion of the fluorapatite phase at sintering temperature of 1000 °C with a reduction in the crystallite size. For both scenarios (sintering temperature and compaction pressure), a consistent trend in mechanical properties (microhardness, fracture toughness and Young's modulus) is noticed at every point of measurement except for compressive strength. The reduction in compressive strength when compaction pressure was applied could be as a result of the stress induced in the HAp powders during compaction which may have made it more susceptible to cracks.

Typically, in a multiple U-line facility, each U-line is designed to work independently which may cause some workstations were not fully functioned. The PAUL aimed at increasing the utilisation of the whole facility by allowing cross-trained workers to work on the opposite legs of the adjacent U-lines (multi-line workstations). This configuration is easier to implement than parallel U-lines due to no restriction in terms of the lengths of U-lines to be paralleled and hidden expenditures that could be incurred in shop floor reconstruction. Since the line balancing of the PAUL is NP-hard and many conflicting objectives need to be optimised simultaneously, the evolutionary meta-heuristic which was the hybridisation of the multi-objective evolutionary algorithm based on decomposition (MOEA/D) and particle swarm optimisation (PSO), namely MOEA/D-PSO, was developed to effectively solve the problem. In addition, the decoding algorithm to convert the solutions obtained from MOEA/D-PSO into the PAUL’s configuration was proposed.

As a result, a Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithm, the so-called ""metaheuristic"", will be conducted to develop the quintessential result for each objective.

The main arguments for deploying PPP are three folds. First, PPP helps governments tap private resources for funding needed investment in infrastructure projects. Second, private's expertise in managing an infrastructure project is highly recognized. And, finally, PPP is believed by many to be delivered in a manner that is more cost-effective than the traditional methods. However, the perception that PPP provides value for money (VfM) over traditional procurement still lacks empirical evidence, especially in Thailand. Accordingly, the main objective of this research project is to develop a computational model that can compare the life cycle cost (LCC) of public and PPP infrastructure projects. Data collection from a group of public and private transportation projects in Thailand will be employed to compare the average life cycle cost between them. The results of this study will provide additional empirical evidence to the body of knowledge in the field of infrastructure management."", 'Success factors for public-private partnership infrastructure projects in Vietnam  2020, Insight Society.Infrastructure projects require a great amount of capital investment resulting from their tremendous size, complexity, and risk. Due to the limitation of public finances, the private sector is invited to participate in infrastructure project development. The private sector can entirely or partially invest in an infrastructure project in the form of a public-private partnership (PPP) scheme, which has been an attractive option for several developing countries, including Vietnam. Unfortunately, despite the PPP scheme will improve project efficiencies and attract capital investments of private investors, the success of PPP implementation is not guaranteed. This paper investigates the critical success factors (CSFs) of PPP infrastructure projects in Vietnam. Relevant data were collected through in-depth interviews with six PPP experts and questionnaire surveys with 150 interviewees and then analyzed by the word cloud technique and the one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) test. The CSFs were ranked based on the viewpoints of the public sector, the private sector, and the PPP consultants. The outcomes show that there was no significant difference in the perceptions of all three parties concerning the success factors for PPP infrastructure projects in Vietnam. The top five critical success factors are (1) timely land acquisition and appropriate compensation, (2) financial capacity of the private sector, (3) effective project management, (4) favorable and complete legal framework and regulations, and (5) financial feasibility and attraction. Recognizing the CSFs is indispensable to ensure the success of PPP infrastructure project implementation.']"

The call center staffs are responsible for resolving customer problems and fulfilling their needs. It is undeniable that customer satisfaction can be increased if personalized services relating to their characteristics such as personality are provided. Researches are suggesting that a person's personality can be recognized from his/her conversational voice. Thus, a machine learning model that recognizes each customer's personality from one's conversational voice in a call center would enable the cell center to give that one appropriate response. This study focuses on developing a personality recognition model to predict each MPI (Maudsley Personality Inventory) personality dimension from each conversational voice. The MPI personality dimension includes E-scale (representing extraversion and introversion) and N-scale (representing neuroticism and stability). Audio files of conversational voice were collected from 92 volunteers instructed to make conversation in the simulated call center context. Logistic regression, LinearSVC, Random forest, and Artificial neural networks were used in the modeling process. The result shows that the model generated by using Artificial neural networks has the best performance on predicting the E-scale. The model has the positive predictive value (Introversion prediction) and the negative predictive value (Extraversion prediction) equal to 0.71 and 0.75, respectively. No model shows satisfying performance on neuroticism and stability prediction. This study shows a piece of evidence that extraversion and introversion in MPI, which have implications in businesses, can be effectively recognized from each person's conversational voice made through call centers. The model can be beneficial in many business applications such as call center management, personalized product offering, and personalized advertisement."", ""Lowercase Letters in Text-Based CAPTCHA: A Visual Perception Analysis  2018 IEEE.CAPTCHA needs a string of letters to verify if a user is human.

Comparison of amino acid residues deduced from the viral nucleotide sequence with those of historical and contemporary norovirus GII.4 strains revealed notable differences, which mapped to the defined antigenic sites of the viral major capsid protein. Time-scaled phylogenetic analysis suggests that GII.4 Hong Kong shared common ancestry with GII.4 Osaka first reported in 2007, and more importantly, did not evolve from the now-prevalent GII.4 Sydney lineage.

Despite the advancement in secondary stroke prevention, the long-term risk of recurrent stroke has remained unchanged. The objective of this study was to identify metabolite risk markers that are associated with recurrent stroke. We performed targeted metabolomic profiling of 162 metabolites by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry in baseline plasma in a stroke case-cohort study nested within the Reasons for Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke (REGARDS) study, an observational cohort study of 30,239 individuals aged 45 and older enrolled in 2003–2007. Weighted Cox proportional hazard models were used to identify metabolites that had a differential effect on first-time versus recurrent stroke using an interaction term between metabolite and prior stroke at baseline (yes or no). The study included 1391 incident stroke cases identified during 7.1 ± 4.5 years of follow-up and 1050 participants in the random cohort sample. Among 162 metabolites, 13 candidates had a metabolite-by-prior stroke interaction at a p-value <0.05, with one metabolite, acetylglutamine, surpassing the Bonferroni adjusted p-value threshold (p for interaction = 5.78 × 10−5). In an adjusted model that included traditional stroke risk factors, acetylglutamine was associated with recurrent stroke (HR = 2.27 per SD increment, 95% CI = 1.60–3.20, p = 3.52 × 10−6) but not with first-time stroke (HR = 0.96 per SD increment, 95% CI = 0.87–1.06, p = 0.44). Acetylglutamine was associated with recurrent stroke but not first-time stroke, independent of traditional stroke risk factors.

However, prior studies have not accounted for intercorrelated metabolite networks. We used exploratory factor analysis (EFA) to determine if metabolite factors were associated with incident ischemic stroke. Metabolites (n = 162) were measured in a case-control cohort nested in the REasons for Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke (REGARDS) study, which included 1,075 ischemic stroke cases and 968 random cohort participants. Cox models were adjusted for age, gender, race, and age-race interaction (base model) and further adjusted for the Framingham stroke risk factors (fully adjusted model). EFA identified fifteen metabolite factors, each representing a well-defined metabolic pathway. Of these, factor 3, a gut microbiome metabolism factor, was associated with an increased risk of stroke in the base (hazard ratio per one-unit standard deviation, HR = 1.23; 95%CI = 1.15–1.31; P = 1.98 × 10−10) and fully adjusted models (HR = 1.13; 95%CI = 1.06–1.21; P = 4.49 × 10−4).

The purpose of this research was to present the results of testing conducted on dredged sediment stabilized with ordinary Portland cement (OPC) and fly ash (FA) for reuse as pavement materials. Materials and methods: The base sediment was high plasticity silt (MH) based on the Unified Soil Classification System (USCS). The experiments in this study consisted of unconfined compression (UC), California bearing ratio (CBR), and resilient modulus (Mr) tests on stabilized dredged sediment. A combination of scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) was used to investigate the microstructures of the stabilized specimens. Finally, a simple comparative cost analysis between roads using conventional earthen materials and stabilized dredged sediment was performed. Results and discussion: The results showed that the unconfined compressive strength (qu), CBR, and Mr improved the pavement materials from unsuitable to suitable, and a 10% FA content provided the optimal strength enhancement. The SEM images showed that the calcium silicate hydrate (CSH) product, which was formed by hydration and pozzolanic reactions, attached to the clay clusters and filled the pore spaces between clay particles, resulting in a denser sediment structure. The EDX analyses showed that the calcium weight proportion and the silica-aluminum ratio were important factors in improving the strength of the dredged sediment treated with OPC and FA. These EDX results agreed with the qu, CBR, and Mr results. For the studied situation, roads using stabilized sediment were 1.5 times more economical than roads using conventional earthen pavement materials.

However, only the compaction technique without treatment by admixtures is insufficient to improve the strength and stiffness of the dredged sediments for use as standard road materials. This research presents the mechanical and microstructural properties of dredged sediments treated with ordinary Portland cement (OPC) and fly ash (FA).

In addition to evaluating the mechanical properties, microscale analyses were also conducted using scanning electron microscopy and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy to understand the behaviour of the dredged sediment with respect to the OPC and FA contents.

The work also proposed empirical correlations for the strength and stiffness parameters of chemically stabilised dredged sediments intended for pavement engineering. Materials and methods: The dredged sediment was collected from the drop-off area around Phayao Lake in Thailand. The sediment’s optimal moisture content was determined by a Proctor compaction test. The OPC and FA content ranged from 3 to 10% and 5 to 20% per dry weight of sediment. The shear strength of treated sediments at different curing time was measured using the unconfined compression (UC) test. Results and discussion: The optimum FA content proved to be most effective in generating the highest material strengths and stiffnesses from the stabilised sediments, regardless of OPC contents and curing duration. A suitable replacement ratio of cement with fly ash was 15%. The results were compared with data on other types of chemically stabilised sediments available in literature. Correlations between engineering properties and design parameters such as UCS, E50, ε f, and eot can be suggested based on the comprehensive experimental results. Conclusions: Using OPC and FA as admixes together provided the greatest improvement in the strength characteristic of dredged sediment.

Graphene alone exhibits electric double layer capacitance (EDLC) with low energy density and high power density. The use of aerogels in a supercapacitor is a pragmatic approach due to its extraordinary properties like ultra-lightweight, high porosity and specific surface area. The aerogels encompass a high volume of pores which leads to easy soak by the electrolyte and fast charge-discharge process. Graphene aerogels assembled into three-dimensional (3D) architecture prevent there stacking of graphene sheets and maintain the high surface area and hence excellent cycling stability and rate capacitance. However, the energy density of graphene aerogels is limited due to EDLC type of charge storage mechanism. Consequently, 3D graphene aerogel coupled with pseudocapacitive materials such as transition metal oxides, metal hydroxides, conducting polymers, nitrides, chalcogenides show an efficient energy density and power density performance due to the presence of both types of charge storage mechanisms.

In doing so, we use a novel interdisciplinary methodology including cluster analysis, classification analysis, partial least squares structural equation modeling and importance-performance map analysis. Our methodology enables policymakers to identify the critical data sources that a given country should focus on in order to improve its position in the CPI ranking relative to other countries. Based on corruption perceptions of 176 countries in the 2016 CPI, our results provide evidence against the CPI's assumptions, as individual data sources have unequal effects on the CPI and exhibit the causal interrelations among one another. Corruption perceptions are not homogeneous across countries, with developed countries showing lower levels of perceived corruption than emerging countries. The presence of synergistic effects among the CPI's data sources suggests that national policymakers consider multiple data sources of the CPI for decision-making process rather than simply focus on any single one of these data sources or their equally-weighted aggregation.

The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of corruption on crime prevention. Design/methodology/approach: This study used an experiment to investigate the effects of criminalisation and corruption. This study tested whether individuals respond differently to variables on the probability of being detected and punishment costs and whether corruption affects these variables. Findings: The results of this study demonstrated that increasing the probability of being detected initially reduces crime rates more efficiently than increasing penalties, then the efficiency gradually reduces, and that corruption reduces the effectiveness of detection and punishment. Research limitations/implications: Ineffective corruption prevention is not solely attributed to corrupt police, as illicit payments and personal connections also contribute to corruption. Practical implications: Policymakers and law enforcement agencies should focus on preventive measures by increasing the chance of being detected, creating transparency and encouraging public participation to address corruption problems thoroughly.

As a result, there is a demand for seeking of oral appliances with antimicrobial properties to reduce the risk of these infections. Here, vanillin (a principal flavoring agent with its antimicrobial property) has been incorporated to orthodontic resin and investigated the effect on biofilm formation of respiratory pathogens.

Both the 0.1% and 0.5% vanillin concentrations could significantly inhibit the biofilm of S. aureus and P. aeruginosa whereas only 0.5% vanillin showed the inhibitory effect on S. epidermidis. Up to 40% biofilm reduction was noticed with S. epidermidis and P. aeruginosa while that of S. aureus was about 30%. In conclusion, the present data demonstrate that the development of orthodontic PMMA resin incorporated with vanillin may be a possible candidate for fabricating of oral appliance with antimicrobial property against respiratory pathogens. This suggests that it could be useful for the prevention or management of respiratory infection related to bacterial biofilm formed on oral appliances.', 'Efficacy of chitosan paste as intracanal medication against Enterococcus faecalis and Candida albicans biofilm compared with calcium hydroxide in an in vitro root canal infection model  2022, The Author(s).Background: Enterococcus faecalis and Candida albicans are frequently found in persistent endodontic infection and could remain in dentinal tubules despite intracanal medication with calcium hydroxide (Ca(OH)2), a commonly used medication. Thus, an effective and safe antimicrobial medication against such refractory infection is necessary in endodontic retreatment, so we aimed to test the efficacy of chitosan paste against these microorganisms compared with Ca(OH)2 in root canals of extracted human teeth. Methods: Thirty-six sterilized human root samples prepared from extracted premolars and upper maxillary incisors were infected with E. faecalis for 14 days, while 32 were infected with C. albicans for 48 h, for mature biofilm formation. The samples were assigned to 6 groups of intracanal medications: Group 1: no medication (negative control); Group 2: 20% Polyethylene glycol (PEG); Group 3: 20% Propylene glycol (PG); Group 4: Ca(OH)2; Group 5: Chitosan + PEG; and Group 6: Chitosan + PG. After 7 days, intracanal surface dentin was harvested using Protaper next, resuspended, serially diluted and spread on Brain–Heart-Infusion agar (for E. faecalis) and Yeast Extract-Peptone-Dextrose agar (for C. albicans) for colony count. Antimicrobial efficacy was determined as percentage of remaining colony forming unit (CFUs) relative to negative control and analyzed using One-way ANOVA and post-hoc Games-Howell test. The significance level was set at 0.05. Results: For E. faecalis, chitosan + PG had significantly higher antibacterial activity than Ca(OH)2 (P = 0.039). Chitosan + PEG and chitosan + PG medication significantly reduced viable bacteria compared with negative control, PEG and PG (P = 0.001, 0.003, 0.024, respectively for chitosan + PEG; P = 0.002, 0.003, 0.014, respectively for chitosan + PG). For C.albicans, chitosan + PEG and chitosan + PG were not significantly different from Ca(OH)2. However, Chitosan + PEG and chitosan + PG, but not Ca(OH)2, showed a significantly lower level of remaining CFUs compared with negative control (P = 0.013 and 0.005, respectively). Conclusion: Chitosan paste showed better efficacy in reducing viable E. faecalis biofilm when compared to Ca(OH)2 after 7-day intracanal medication in this in vitro root canal model. It could also significantly reduce viable C. albicans, but was not significantly different from Ca(OH)2.']"

The most common mechanism of fluconazole resistance in C. albicans is the failure of cells to accumulate the drug due to increased expression of the efflux proteins encoded by the CDR1, CDR2, and MDR1 genes. Because the number of current antifungal drugs is limited, it is necessary to develop new therapeutic strategies. This study aimed to evaluate the antifungal activity of Thai Cajuput oil, its synergism with fluconazole, and its effect on efflux-pump gene expression in fluconazole-resistant C. albicans clinical isolates. Thus, we first detected the efflux-pump genes in fourteen resistant strains by PCR. The frequencies of the CDR1, CDR2, and MDR1 genes were 68.75%, 62.5%, and 87.5%, respectively, and these efflux-pump genes were distributed in three distinct patterns. Subsequently, the antifungal activity of Thai Cajuput oil was assessed by broth macrodilution and its synergism with fluconazole was evaluated by the checkerboard assay. The changes in the expression levels of CDR1, CDR2, and MDR1 after treatment with Thai Cajuput oil were analyzed by qRT-PCR. The MICs and MFCs of Thai Cajuput oil ranged from 0.31 to 1.25 μl/ml and 0.63 to 1.25 μl/ml, respectively, and its activity was defined as fungicidal activity. The MICs of the combination of Thai Cajuput oil and fluconazole were much lower than the MICs of the individual drugs. Interestingly, sub-MICs of Thai Cajuput oil significantly reduced the MDR1 expression level in resistant strains P<0.05. Our study suggests that Thai Cajuput oil can be used to create new potential combination therapies to combat the antifungal resistance of C. albicans.', ""CdtC-induced processing of membrane-bound CdtA is a crucial step in Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans cytolethal distending toxin holotoxin formation  2018 American Society for Microbiology.Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans is an oral pathogen causing periodontal disease and bacterial endocarditis. It produces cytolethal distending toxin (CDT) that could damage mammalian cells and tissues. CDT is a tripartite protein toxin composed of CdtA, CdtB, and CdtC. We have previously indicated that CdtA is a lipoprotein and that the proteolytic processing of CdtA is important for biogenesis and secretion of CDT holotoxin. Here, we established an in vitro processing assay of CdtA and investigated the interactions of CdtA with other Cdt subunits. This assay demonstrated that incubation of membrane-bound CdtA (MCdtA), CdtB, and CdtC immediately generated a processed form of CdtA (CdtA'), which is recovered from the soluble fraction. In contrast, incubation of soluble membraneunbound CdtA with CdtB and CdtC did not yield any CdtA'. Furthermore, incubation of CdtC with MCdtA was enough to induce rapid processing of MCdtA, whereas CdtB alone was unable to induce the processing. Coimmunoprecipitation demonstrated that CdtA' and CdtC formed a complex. Furthermore, subsequent addition of CdtB to this reaction mixture resulted in complete CDT holotoxin complex. The cytolethal distending activity assay demonstrated that CDT complex containing CdtA' showed far stronger cytotoxicity than that containing CdtA. Collectively, our data suggest that CDT holotoxin formation in vivo is a sequential event: interaction of MCdtA and CdtC induces proteolytic processing of MCdtA, and the released CdtA' forms a complex with CdtC. Subsequent binding of CdtB to the CdtA'/CdtC complex results in CDT holotoxin formation."", 'Host chromatin regulators required for aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans cytolethal distending toxin activity in Saccharomyces cerevisiae model Copyright  2021 American Society for Microbiology. All Rights Reserved.Cytolethal distending toxin (CDT) is a bacterial genotoxin that causes host cell cycle arrest and death. We previously employed a Saccharomyces cerevisiae model with inducible expression of the CDT catalytic subunit from Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, AaCdtB, and showed that a wide variety of host factors play a role in facilitating the activity of CdtB. Our observation that a yeast H2B mutant defective in chromatin condensation was partially resistant to CdtB implies that chromatin structure may affect CDT function. In this study, we identified host chromatin regulatory genes required for CdtB cytotoxicity. We found that the deletion of HTZ1 or certain subunits of SWR, INO80, and SIR complexes increased cellular resistance to CdtB. We hypothesized that CdtB may interact with Htz1 or the chromatin, but immunoprecipitation experiments failed to detect physical interaction between CdtB and Htz1 or the chromatin. However, we observed reduced nuclear localization of CdtB in several mutants, suggesting that impaired nuclear translocation may, at least partly, explain the mechanisms of CdtB resistance. In addition, mutations in chromatin regulatory genes induce changes in the global gene expression profile, and these may indirectly affect CdtB toxicity. Our results suggest that decreased expression of endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-Golgi transport-related genes that may be involved in CdtB transport and/or increased expression of DNA repair genes may contribute to CdtB resistance. These results suggest that the functions of chromatin regulators may contribute to the activity of CDT in host cells.']"

All rights reserved.Background: Patient access to anti-cancer medicines is challenging in Thailand and worldwide. Objective: This study aimed to explain and quantify access to anti-cancer medicines in Thailand. Methods: Mixed methods of literature review and in-depth interview were conducted. Access to anticancer medicines was compared to the World Health Organization-Model List of Essential Medicines (WHO-EML), and recommendations of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN). Results: Access to National List of Essential Medicines (NLEM) is indifferent among the three public schemes. Universal coverage scheme (UCS) and Social security scheme (SSS) limit access to non-NLEM anticancer medicines by reimbursement caps. Civil Servant Medical Benefit Scheme (CSMBS) provides broader access through Oncology Prior Authorization program. Non-NLEM, non-negative listed medicines are reimbursable if physicians deem necessary. Patient access programs were offered by pharmaceutical companies to assist access to non-reimbursable medicines for self-paying patients. UCS-SSS and CSMBS had 89.7% and 100% of medicines in WHO-EML. However, UCS-SSS had 19.2-100% of NCCN medicines for early-stage and 5.9-52.6% for advanced-stage cancers, while CSMBS had more access (57.7-100% and 41.2-84.2%, respectively). Conclusion: Access inequity to anti-cancer medicine was confirmed. However, Thais have adequate access to first- and second-line medicines for both early- and advanced-stage cancers. All stakeholders should consider formulating innovative financial models for high-cost anticancer medicines.', 'Access to medicines for breast, colorectal, and lung cancer in Thailand  2018, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Chulalongkorn University. All rights reserved.Aim: Cancer drugs have become prohibitive, and consequently their accessibility has increasingly been of great concern in many countries. Particularly, the information about cancer drug access in Thailand has been sporadic. Therefore, the goal of the study was to examine the antineoplastic drug accessibility in Thailand in terms of both market access and patient access. In addition, this study evaluated antineoplastic drugs based on cancer incidence in Thailand, and especially those for the top 3 common cancer types: Breast cancer, colorectal cancer, and lung cancer. Method: The study method was descriptive in nature to evaluate the number of antineoplastic drugs in both Thai market and reimbursement list or National List of Essential Medicines to reflect the market access and patient access, respectively. In determining Thailand’s market access, the number of active ingredients (APIs) of antineoplastic drugs was obtained from the WHO website as a reference to the number of Thailand’s marketing authorization approvals (MAAs) of antineoplastic drugs as per the Thai FDA website. For the determination of patient access, the number of antineoplastic drugs available to Thai patients was extracted from 2016 NLEM so that it can be compared to Thailand’s MAAs. For further delineation with respect to treatments for each cancer type (ranked by cancer incidence in Thailand), the total number of APIs for each cancer type was used to determine market access and patient access. Results: The accessibility of antineoplastic drugs was 49% (88 of 180 APIs of WHO) for Thailand’s market access and 43% (38 of 88 APIs in Thailand) for the patient access. For the top 3 cancer types, the market access was of a high percentage while the patient access from NLEM list was of low percentage. Conclusions: The market accessibility of antineoplastic drugs did not pose a problem for Thailand. Registrations of anti-cancer drugs undoubtedly played a key role for the market accessibility. However, new innovative antineoplastic drugs have presented a rather considerable concern for Thai patients, which are further complicated by the NLEM selection process and the limitation of use according to the categories outlined in the NLEM requirements. Therefore, improvement is clearly needed for patient access to new innovative antineoplastic drugs.', 'Cost-effectiveness and budget impact analyses of colorectal cancer screenings in a low- and middle-income country: example from Thailand  2019,  2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.Objectives: Colorectal cancer (CRC) screening programs have been reported to be cost-effective in many high-income countries. However, there was no such study in low- and middle-income countries. This study aimed to evaluate cost-effectiveness and budget impact of CRC screening modalities for average-risk persons in Thailand. Methods: A decision tree coupled with a Markov model was used to estimate lifetime costs and health benefits of fecal immunochemical test (FIT) and colonoscopy using a societal perspective. The input parameters were obtained from a CRC screening project at a Thai tertiary care hospital, Thai health care costs and databases, and systematic literature review. Results were reported as incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) in 2017 US Dollars (USD) per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained. Sensitivity analyses were performed to assess the influence of parameter uncertainty. Finally, budget impact analysis was conducted. Results: At the Thai ceiling threshold of societal willingness-to-pay of 4,706 USD, the screening colonoscopy every 10 years and annual FIT, starting at age 50, was cost-effective, as compared to no screening resulting in 15.09 and 15.00 QALYs with the ICERs of 600.20 and 509.84 USD/QALY gained, respectively. Colonoscopy every 10 years and annual FIT could prevent 17.9% and 5.7% of early stage cancer and 27.8% and 9.2% of late stage cancer per 100,000 screening over lifetime when compared to no screening, respectively. The colonoscopy screening was cost-effective with the ICER of 646.53 USD/QALY gained when compared to FIT. The probabilities of being cost-effective for the colonoscopy and FIT were 75% and 25%, respectively. Budget impact analysis showed the colonoscopy screening required an 8-times higher budget than FIT. Conclusions: Colonoscopy offers the best value for money of CRC screenings in Thailand. Annual FIT is potentially feasible since it requires less resources. Our findings can be used as part of evidence for informing policy decision making.Key points for decision makers There was a lack of cost-effective study of colorectal cancer screening programs in low- and middle-income countries. This study evaluated lifetime health outcomes and costs, and the cost-effectiveness of colorectal screening options for average-risk persons in Thailand. Colonoscopy screening every 10 years is cost-effective with high probability of being cost-effective as compared with annual fecal immunochemical test. Screening by annual fecal immunochemical test is more feasible in terms of human resource and budgetary burden. Colorectal screening programs provides an opportunity for early diagnosis and treatments to prevent advance colorectal stages and avoid higher consequent costs. This study contributes a new evidence-based knowledge for Thailand and can be used to support policy decision making process.']"

Potential associations between body composition, masticatory performance and OHRQoL were also investigated. Methods: This cross-sectional study included 110 older adults who received prosthodontic treatment at the Dental Faculty Clinics at Chulalongkorn University. Participants were categorized according to their dental prostheses: complete denture (CD), removable partial denture (RPD) and fixed partial denture (FPD). Retention and stability of the RPD and CD were evaluated using the CU-modified Kapur and the modified NHANES III criteria to classify denture quality into acceptable and unacceptable. Dental status including posterior occluding pairs and number of remaining natural teeth were assessed intraorally. Dependent variables were body composition, masticatory performance and OHRQoL. Body composition, including muscle mass (kg), bone mass (kg), basal metabolic rate (kcal) and visceral fat (%) were determined through a bioelectrical impedance analysis. Masticatory performance was assessed using a multiple sieve method of peanut mastication. OHRQoL was assessed using the validated Thai version of Oral Impacts on Daily Performances (Thai-OIDP) index. After adjusting for covariates, including age and sex, the associations between oral and dental prosthesis status and body composition, masticatory performance as well as OIDP score were analyzed using multivariable linear and negative binomial regression analyses. Spearman’s correlation was used to determine the potential associations between body composition, masticatory performance and OHRQoL. Results: The presence of fewer natural teeth or wearing an unacceptable removable denture were factors associated with lower bone mass, muscle mass and basal metabolic rate, and with a higher visceral fat. Similar dental and removable denture status were also associated with larger peanut particle size and higher OIDP score. Masticatory performance and OHRQoL variables were moderately correlated (Spearman's rho = 0.44). However, body composition was not correlated with masticatory performance or OHRQoL.

However, no standard criteria are available for professionally based assessment of complete denture quality. Purpose: The purpose of this clinical study was to determine the association between professionally based assessment of complete denture quality, evaluated by conventional and Chulalongkorn University (CU)-modified Kapur criteria and multiple patient-based outcomes: oral health-related quality of life (OHRQoL), eating satisfaction, and masticatory performance. The sensitivity and specificity of these criteria in estimating the outcomes were investigated. Material and methods: The participants were 126 individuals with removable acrylic resin complete dentures. Denture retention and stability were scored based on the Kapur method, with excellent intraobserver reliability indicated by a Kappa score of 0.91 to 0.99. The clinical quality of the complete denture was classified according to conventional and CU-modified Kapur criteria. The participants were interviewed for OHRQoL by using the Thai version of the Oral Impacts on Daily Performances (OIDP) index and responses were reported as the absence or presence of oral impacts. Participants’ satisfaction eating with their dentures was determined by using a 5-point Likert scale and dichotomized into satisfied and dissatisfied categories. Masticatory performance was evaluated by the multiple sieve method of peanut mastication. After adjusting for covariates, the associations between denture quality and overall and condition-specific (CS) impacts on eating and on eating satisfaction were analyzed by using binary logistic regression, while its association with masticatory performance was determined using linear regression. Goodness-of-fit post estimation was conducted to determine the sensitivity and specificity of each denture quality criterion in estimating patient-based outcomes. Results: Complete denture retention and stability, evaluated by conventional and CU-modified Kapur criteria, were associated with multiple patient-based outcomes. However, denture stability showed a stronger association than retention. The CU-modified criteria assessed the quality of maxillary and mandibular dentures individually and revealed a higher sensitivity in estimating all patient-based outcomes. Conclusions: Retention and stability were important indicators in estimating the masticatory ability and OHRQoL of complete denture wearers. The CU-modified Kapur criteria can identify impaired masticatory ability and OHRQoL in complete denture wearers better than conventional criteria.', ""Subjective and objective measures for evaluating masticatory ability and associating factors of complete denture wearers: A clinical study  2020 Editorial Council for the Journal of Prosthetic DentistryStatement of problem: The masticatory ability of complete denture (CD) wearers can be evaluated subjectively and objectively. Although an objective measure reflects a person's ability to masticate food, it is rarely used in clinical practice. Moreover, the factors associated with subjective and objective masticatory ability of CD wearers remain unclear. Purpose: The purpose of this clinical study was to identify subjective and objective measures that better reflect the masticatory ability of CD wearers and to investigate their associating factors. Material and methods: Masticatory ability was evaluated in 130 CD wearers by using subjective and objective measures. The subjective indicators were oral impact on eating and denture satisfaction based on eating or mastication ability. Masticatory performance was objectively measured by using a median peanut particle size. The maximum occlusal force, number, and area of occlusal contacts were determined from a pressure-sensitive sheet. CD retention and stability were classified into acceptable and unacceptable denture quality following the CU-modified Kapur criteria. The occlusal pattern and oral conditions were examined and recorded. Intraexaminer reliability in determining CD quality and oral condition was shown by a Kappa score of 0.90 to 0.95. Multivariable linear and logistic regressions were performed to analyze the associations between CD quality, maximum occlusal force, and masticatory ability. The Spearman correlation was used to determine the association between subjective and objective measures. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) between subjective and objective measures were calculated. Results: Unacceptable CD quality was significantly associated with oral impact on eating, eating dissatisfaction, and larger peanut particle size (P<.001). Peanut particle size increased with lower maximum occlusal force, which was related to fewer occlusal contacts and the female sex. The highest to lowest adjusted R2 values were related to masticatory performance, oral impact on eating, and eating satisfaction models. Among participants with unacceptable CD quality, 16% had higher masticatory performance, 25%, had no oral impact on eating, and 33% reported eating satisfaction. The sensitivity and specificity values of subjective measures in predicting lower masticatory performance were approximately recorded at 74% and 90%, respectively, whereas PPV and NPV were at 90% and 77%, respectively. Conclusions: CD retention and stability impact objective and subjective masticatory ability. Objective masticatory performance is the best measure for evaluating the masticatory ability of CD wearers, followed by oral impact on eating and eating satisfaction. A 3.6-mm peanut particle size is suggested as a cutoff value for identifying CD wearers with impaired masticatory ability.""]"

By simply conjugating benzimidazole (Bz) with magnetic nanoparticles (MagNPs) followed by applying magnetic field, Bz can be induced and aligned on the surface of sulfonated poly (ether ether ketone) (SPEEK) membrane and this results in 10% increment of the proton conductivity.

In order to obtain the effective and efficient proton transfer, the present work proposes a membrane with proton donors and proton acceptors in layer-by-layer (LbL) structure. By applying sulfonated poly (ether ether ketone) (SPEEK) as the substrate membrane and soaking alternatively with the proton donor polymer, i.e. poly(acrylic acid) (PAA), and the proton acceptor heterocycles, i.e. benzimidazoles (BI), the LbL SPEEK/BI/PAA membranes can be achieved. The systematic variation based on the branching benzimidazole groups suggest that the LbL SPEEK/BI/PAA membrane obtained shows an increase in proton conductivity compared to the neat SPEEK, especially in the case of the membrane with trifunctional benzimidazole (B4) is as high as 1–2.5 orders of magnitude over the temperature range of 30–170 °C.

Here we show that the differences in PRA and PRB structure facilitate the binding of common and distinct protein interacting partners affecting the downstream signaling events of each PR-isoform. Tet-inducible HA-tagged PRA or HA-tagged PRB constructs were expressed in T47DC42 (PR/ER negative) breast cancer cells. Affinity purification coupled with stable isotope labeling of amino acids in cell culture (SILAC) mass spectrometry technique was performed to comprehensively study PRA and PRB interacting partners in both unliganded and liganded conditions. To validate our findings, we applied both forward and reverse SILAC conditions to effectively minimize experimental errors. These datasets will be useful in investigating PRA- and PRB-specific molecular mechanisms and as a database for subsequent experiments to identify novel PRA and PRB interacting proteins that differentially mediated different biological functions in breast cancer.', 'Differential quantitative proteomics reveals key proteins related to phenotypic changes of breast cancer cells expressing progesterone receptor A  2019Progesterone receptor isoforms A and B exert different biological effects in breast cancer cells. Alteration of PRA/PRB ratio is often observed during breast cancer progression. High PRA/PRB ratios in breast cancer patients are associated with resistance to chemotherapy and poor prognosis. While it is well accepted that PRA and PRB regulate different sets of genes, how the expression of PRA and PRB alters breast cancer proteomes has not been fully investigated. To directly investigate the effects of PR isoform expression on the breast cancer proteome, both in the presence and absence of progestin, PRA and PRB were independently stably expressed in T47DC42 PR-null breast cancer cells using a doxycycline (Dox)-regulated promoter. Dox induction dose-dependently increased PRA and PRB expression. Dox-induced PRA and PRB showed normal receptor localization and were transcriptionally active. Differential quantitative proteomic analysis by stable isotope dimethyl labeling was performed to quantitatively examine how PR isoforms altered global breast cancer proteomes. Cells expressing PRA in the absence of progestin were enriched in proteins involved in the TCA cycle and enriched in proteins involved in glycolysis in the presence of progestin, whilst cells expressing PRB in the absence and presence progestin were significantly enriched in proteins involved in the cell cycle and cell apoptosis pathways. This proteomic data revealed a link between PR isoform expression and alteration in cell metabolism, cell proliferation, and apoptosis. The enrichment of proteins involved in the glycolytic pathway in breast cancer cells expressing PRA is consistent with stem cell-like properties, previously reported in PRA-rich breast cancer cells. Moreover, compared to liganded PRB, liganded PRA differentially upregulated proteins involved in chromatin remodeling, such as linker histone H1.2. Silencing H1.2 gene expression suppressed PRA-mediated cell proliferation and promoted G2/M and S phase entry of the cell cycle. Additionally, liganded PRA upregulated the expression of cathepsin D (CTSD) protease, whose expression is associated with poor prognosis in breast cancer patients. Together, our data demonstrated that the expression of PRA or PRB dramatically and differentially altered breast cancer cell proteomes. These isoform-specific changes in the breast cancer proteome will help to explain the distinct phenotypic properties of breast cancer cells expressing different levels of PRA and PRB.', 'Progesterone receptor isoform B expression in pulmonary neuroendocrine cells decreases cell proliferation  2019 Elsevier LtdThe progesterone receptor (PR) has been reported to play important roles in lung development and function, such as alveolarization, alveolar fluid clearance (AFC) and upper airway dilator muscle activity. In the lung, pulmonary neuroendocrine cells (PNECs) are important in the etiology and progression of lung neuroendocrine tumors (NETs). Women with lung NETs had significantly better survival rates than men, suggesting that sex steroids and their receptors, such as the PR, could be involved in the progression of lung NETs. The PR exists as two major isoforms, PRA and PRB. How the expression of different PR isoforms affects proliferation and the development of lung NETs is not well understood. To determine the role of the PR isoforms in PNECs, we constructed H727 lung NET cell models expressing PRB, PRA, Green Fluorescence Protein (GFP) (control). The expression of PRB significantly inhibited H727 cell proliferation better than that of PRA in the absence of progestin. The expression of the unrelated protein, GFP, had little to no effect on H727 cell proliferation. To better understand the role of the PR isoform in PNECs, we examined PR isoform expression in PNECs in lung tissues. A monoclonal antibody specific to the N-terminus of PRB (250H11 mAb) was developed to specifically recognize PRB, while a monoclonal antibody specific to a common N-terminus epitope present in both PRA and PRB (1294 mAb) was used to detect both PRA and PRB. Using these PR and PRB-specific antibodies, we demonstrated that PR (PRA&PRB) and PRB were expressed in the PNECs of the normal fetal and adult lung, with significantly higher PR expression in the fetal lung. Interestingly, PRB expression in the normal lung was associated with lower cell proliferation than PR expression, suggesting a distinct role of PRB in the PNECs. A better understanding of the molecular mechanism of PR and PR isoform signaling in lung NET cells may help in developing novel therapeutic strategies that will benefit lung NET patients in the future.']"

Failure under ultimate load was accompanied by crushing of concrete, buckling of compression longitudinal bars and posttension tendons at the midspan. Further, experimental rosette strains suggested that concrete strains remained well below the ultimate of strains in the vicinity of high shear zones of the girder. Therefore, these results augment that the proposed design practice is safe against shear and the proposed girder can safely be used as the end girder in four-span straddle monorail system. Nonlinear analysis of the girder was performed using advanced tool for engineering nonlinear analysis by adopting its built-in constitutive laws for concrete and steel reinforcement. Predicted analytical response of FPP was in good agreement with experimental results in terms of load-deflection curves, crack patterns, and failure mode."", 'Axial load-strain relationships of partially encased composite columns with H-shaped steel sections Copyright  2022 Techno-Press, Ltd.This paper presents the axial compression behavior of partially encased composite (PEC) columns using H-shaped structural steel.

The data supporting the utility of ASPs has come largely from adult hospital units, but few pediatric hospital units have implemented ASPs. Our objective for this study was to assess the impact of ASPs in pediatric units in tertiary care teaching hospitals. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective chart review to compare antimicrobial use pre- and post-ASP over a 6-month period in a tertiary care hospital in which an ASP had been in use since July 2017. Meropenem, vancomycin, and colistin were selected to be monitored. ASP rounds were conducted twice a week to assess and provide feedback on antimicrobial prescriptions. Antimicrobial use was measured as days of therapy (DOTs) per 1000 patient-days and was compared pre- and post-ASP by using independent t tests. RESULTS: Charts of children hospitalized who were in antimicrobial treatment pre-ASP (44.3%) and post-ASP (41.7%) were reviewed. The percentages of children who received selected antimicrobial agents did not differ between pre- and post-ASP. During the post-ASP period, a significant reduction in DOT with vancomycin and colistin was observed. Vancomycin use decreased from 58.5 to 40.2 DOTs per 1000 patient-days (P 5 .038), and colistin decreased from 36.3 to 13.8 DOTs per 1000 patient-days (P 5 .026). Meropenem use decreased from 126.8 to 111.2 DOTs per 1000 patient-days (P 5 .467). Between the 2 periods, there was no effect on length of stay and mortality. CONCLUSIONS: ASPs can lead to a significant reduction in selected antimicrobial use in children who are hospitalized, with no effect on length of stay or mortality rate.', 'Antimicrobial prescription patterns in a tertiary-care pediatric unit in Thailand  2020 Japan Pediatric SocietyBackground: Antimicrobial resistance is one of the greatest public health threats worldwide. The improper prescription of antibiotics is one factor that promotes antibiotic resistance. Access to antimicrobial surveillance data is essential when assessing the pattern and appropriateness of antimicrobial prescriptions in hospitals and for the establishment of an antimicrobial stewardship program. This study aimed to describe the rate of antimicrobial use and the pattern of prescriptions in a tertiary care pediatric unit in Thailand. Methods: A point prevalence survey on antimicrobial use was conducted monthly between January and June 2016, using standardized tools. The survey included all inpatient pediatric beds and identified all children receiving antimicrobial treatment on the day of the survey. Results: The study included 644 children, 43.3% of whom received antimicrobial treatment during hospitalization. In general wards, the rate of antimicrobial prescriptions was 37.2%; in oncology wards it was 47.0%; in intensive care units it was 38.7%, and in surgical wards it was 67.7%. Meropenem was the most prescribed antimicrobial in the general wards (24.5%) and intensive care units (28.6%), whereas antipseudomonas was the most commonly prescribed antimicrobial in the oncology ward (26.6%). For the surgical ward, the most prescribed antimicrobial was third-generation cephalosporin for both prophylaxis and treatment (39.0%). The most common reason for antimicrobial use was the treatment of infections. Conclusions: Nearly half of hospitalized children received at least one antimicrobial. This was comparable with other pediatric tertiary care centers, although the high use of meropenem was different. This study provides important baseline information on antimicrobial use in a large tertiary-care pediatric unit and could lead to a nationwide survey in the future.', 'Point prevalence survey of antimicrobial prescription patterns in a pediatric tertiary-care unit in thailand 2019  JOURNAL OF THE MEDICAL ASSOCIATION OF THAILAND | 2021.Background: Surveillance data is an essential part of antimicrobial stewardship programs (ASP). Objective: To describe and compare prescription patterns of antibiotics after a 3-years implementation of an ASP using prospective audit and feedback. Materials and Methods: The authors conducted a point prevalence survey (PPS) of antibiotic prescriptions at a 200-bed pediatric unit at King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital. A standardized study protocol from the Global Antimicrobial Resistance, Prescribing, and the Efficacy in Neonates and Children (GARPEC) project was used. The authors reviewed medical charts of hospitalized children of less than 18 years of age, using a point prevalence method on the 15 of February, May, August, and November 2019. Endpoints measures included rate of antimicrobial prescriptions and type of antimicrobial use, stratified by neonatal and pediatric ward types. Rate of antimicrobial prescriptions will be compared with historical data form PPS in the same institute collected in 2016. Results: In 2019, the medical records of 269 neonates and 409 children hospitalized were reviewed. The proportion of children receiving antibiotics in neonatal units overall was 18.6% (95% CI 14.1 to 23.8), of which ampicillin or gentamicin (52.0%) was the most common regimen. Rate of antibiotic prescriptions in general pediatric wards was 46.5%, with third generation cephalosporins being the most used antibiotics. Prescription rate in the oncology ward was 52.9% with antipseudomonal agents or meropenem being the most prescribed antibiotics. Prescription rates in the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) was 88.9%, with meropenem being the most used antibiotic. Compared to a previous PPS study in 2016, prevalence of antimicrobial use was higher in general pediatric wards at 46.5% versus 37.2% (p=0.02) and PICU at 88.9% versus 67.7% (p=0.007). Conclusion: The prevalence rates of antimicrobial use in pediatric wards increased despite implementation of a prospective audit and feedback antibiotic stewardship program. Other measures are needed to reduce the unnecessary prescriptions.']"

A previous study reported that methylation of CCNA1, a tumor suppressor gene, can differentiate between low and high grade lesions. This study was designed to evaluate the diagnostic values and application of CCNA1 methylation in the patients with ASC-US group. Materials and Methods: Cross sectional analytic study was conducted in the patients with ASC-US cytology. HPV DNA testing and CCNA1 promoter methylation testing were performed. The patients were sent for colposcopic examination and biopsy. Biopsy results were considered as gold standard. Diagnostic test of HPV test and CCNA1 methylation test were calculated for sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive value (NPV), positive predictive value (PPV), likelihood ratio for test positive and negative and 95% confidence interval. Results: One hundred and seventy patients were enrolled. Mean age was 39.7 years old. HR-HPV was positive in 70% of the patients. HPV type 16, type 18 and non-16,18 were 12.4%, 4.7% and 42.4%, respectively. CIN2+ were found in 12.4% (21 cases). CCNA1 promoter methylation was positive in 5 cases. CCNA1 had high specificity 99.3%, NPV 89.2% and PPV 80% in detection of CIN2+ but sensitivity was 19%. Likelihood ratio for positive test was 28.4 and likelihood ratio for negative test was 0.8. HPV test had sensitivity of 90.5% and NPV of 95.9% but low specificity and PPV as 31.5% and 15.7%, respectively. Conclusion: CCNA1 promoter methylation testing had very high specificity, likelihood ratio for the positive test and PPV (99.3%, 28.4 and 80.0, respectively). Therefore, CCNA1 promoter methylation test may be used in the HPV DNA positive cases to classify the urgency of colposcopy and the colposcopist should pay more attention to CCNA1 positive patients because of their higher chance to identify the significant lesions.', 'Promoter methylation of tumor suppressor genes induced by human papillomavirus in cervical cancer  2020 Spandidos Publications. All rights reserved.Cervical cancer is the most fourth common cancer in women worldwide. The E6 and E7 high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) types are the main cause of this cancer. Several studies have revealed that promoter methylation of tumor suppressor genes is induced by HPV E7. Recently, it was found that HPV16-E7 and the DNA methyltransferase 1 complex could bind at the cyclin A1 (CCNA1) promoter, resulting in CCNA1 promoter methylation. Therefore, there is a need to study other tumor suppressor genes for which HPV may induce promoter methylation. The present study investigated whether HPV induced cell adhesion molecule 1 (CADM1) and death associated protein kinase 1 (DAPK1) promoter methylation. C33a (no HPV infection) and SiHa (HPV 16 infection) cell lines were used for methylation status and expression observation. It was found that CADM1 and DAPK1 promoter methylation, no expression of CADM1 and decreased expression of DAPK1, was presented in SiHa cells. While no promoter methylation of these two genes was observed in C33a cells, with positive expression of the genes. It was subsequently investigated whether E6 and/or E7 could induce promoter methylation and decrease the expression of these two genes. Methylation-specific primer PCR and quantitative PCR were performed to elucidate the promoter methylation status and expression of CADM1 and DAPK1 in C33a cells transfected with HPV16 E6-PCDNA3 or HPV16 E7-PCDNA3.1 myc-his, compared to empty vector-transfected cells. The results showed that HPV E7 could induce CADM1 promoter methylation and decrease the gene expression in HPV E7 transfected C33a cells, while HPV E6 could induce DAPK1 promoter methylation and decrease its expression in C33a cells transfected with HPV E6. Finally, the mechanism by which HPV E7 induced CADM1 promoter methylation was observed by performing chromatin immunoprecipitation; the data showed that E7 induced CADM1 methylation by the same mechanism as that for CCNA1, by binding at the CADM1 promoter, resulting in the subsequent reduction of its expression in cervical cancer.', ""Association between promoter methylation and gene expression of CGB3 and NOP56 in HPV-infected cervical cancer cells  2022, Spandidos Publications. All rights reserved.Overexpression of the E7 gene of human papil-lomavirus (HPV) type 16 is one of the primary causes of cervical cancer. The E7 protein can bind with DNA meth-yltransferase I and induce methylation of tumor suppressor genes, such as cyclin-A1 (CCNA1), leading to suppression of their expression, and thus, cancer progression. In the present study, the confirmation of methylation-related expression of chorionic gonadotropin subunit 3 (CGB3) and nucleolar protein 56 (NOP56) genes in 5-Azacytidine (5'-aza)-treated HPV16-positive SiHa and HPV16-negative C33A cell lines was shown. Using methylation-specific-PCR and quantitative PCR, the results showed that CGB3 and NOP56 methyla-tion significantly decreased as the 5'-aza concentration was increased, and this was inversely associated with their expression. Moreover, overexpression of E7 contributed to the augmentation of CGB3 and NOP56 methylation levels in C33A cells, resulting in a decrease in their expression. This study extends on previous observations of E7 HPV16 onco-genic function in terms of methylation-repressing expression in more genes, which may be wholly applied to gene therapy in cervical cancer prevention.""]"

It is found that the functional molecules that formed upon the caramelization of sugar enhance the performance of the PSF membranes in terms of their permeability as well as the hydrophilicity. Thus, the PSF-based flat sheet membranes were prepared by phase inversion technique with different additional amounts of caramel (i.e., 50 mg, 150 mg and 250 mg). The prepared membranes were characterized and their performance was evaluated by pure water flux, water uptake and contact angle measurements. Studies on the rejection and fouling properties of membranes in water treatment were carried out using Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA). The modified membranes showed a significantly enhanced flux of ∼350 L/m2 h and the rejection of BSA was found to be 90%. It was also found that the antifouling capacity of the PSF membranes enhanced with caramel modification.

However, drawbacks caused by its lower-than-expected flux performance and fouling issues remain bottlenecks that limit the wider applications of FO technology. In this research, titanium dioxide (TiO2) nanoparticles were grafted onto two commercially available FO membranes, a cellulose triacetate (CTA) membrane and an aquaporin (AqP) membrane, through a specially designed 3-(trimethoxysilyl)propyl methacrylate-polymethyl methacrylate-bromide (MEMO-PMMA-Br) monomer chain, to improve the filtration performance with regard to pure water flux and organic fouling resistance. The success of the surface coating method was verified using FT-IR, SEM-EDX, and AFM. Approximately 30% titanium coverage was obtained for both FO membranes. A reduction of the contact angle on the modified CTA membrane surface indicated enhanced water permeability and antifouling performance. An adverse effect on the surface hydrophilicity of the modified AqP membrane may be attributed to the obstruction of aquaporins from the feed solution due to the coverage of MEMO-PMMA-Br monomers and TiO2 nanoparticles. The pure water flux of both membranes was significantly improved, with average flux increases of 73.4% and 13.6% identified for the modified CTA and AqP membranes, respectively. In addition, the antifouling performance of the AqP membrane was greatly enhanced after surface modification, attributed to the integrated effects of foulant photodegradation (catalyzed by TiO2 nanoparticles at the interface) and the prevention of functional water channels being blocked by organic foulants due to TiO2 coverage.', 'Enhancing the antibacterial properties of PVDF membrane by hydrophilic surface modification using titanium dioxide and silver nanoparticles  2020 by the authors.

PVDF membranes were coated with nanoparticles of titanium dioxide (TiO2-NP) and silver (AgNP) at different concentrations and coating times and characterized for their porosity, morphology, chemical functional groups and composition changes. The results showed the successfully modified PVDF membranes containing TiO2-NP and AgNP on their surfaces. When the coating time was increased from 8 to 24 h, the compositions of Ti and Ag of the modified membranes were increased from 1.39 ± 0.13 to 4.29 ± 0.16 and from 1.03 ± 0.07 to 3.62 ± 0.08, respectively. The water contact angle of the membranes was decreased with increasing the coating time and TiO2-NP/AgNP ratio. The surface roughness and permeate fluxes of coated membranes were increased due to increased hydrophilicity. Antimicrobial and antifouling properties were investigated by the reduction of Escherichia coli cells and the inhibition of biofilm formation on the membrane surface, respectively. Compared with that of the original PVDF membrane, the modified membranes exhibited antibacterial efficiency up to 94% against E. coli cells and inhibition up to 65% of the biofilm mass reduction. The findings showed hydrophilic improvement and an antimicrobial property for possible wastewater treatment without facing the eminent problem of biofouling.']"

They could easily access CMs like herbal or traditional medicines in community pharmacies. Therefore, community pharmacists are important professionals in advising the safe choices of CMs and providing evidence-based information for customers to decrease adverse effects of CMs. Objectives: To systematically review knowledge, attitude, and practices of community pharmacists about CMs, and the factors associated with CM practices of dispensing, recommending and counseling patients, and answering the patients’ queries. Method: An electronic search was performed with four databases: PubMed, Scopus, SpringerLink and ScienceDirect, from 1990 to 19th May 2022. The inclusion criteria were studies 1) about knowledge, attitude, and/or practices of community pharmacists about CMs, 2) written in English, 3) conducted with quantitative methods, and 4) able to retrieve full text. Results: Twenty-three studies were included in this systematic review. Some studies showed that less than half of the pharmacists asked or counselled about CMs to their patients and answered the patients’ queries about CMs. Only 20% of the pharmacists did report CM side-effects. Training or education about CMs was a common factor associated with the CM practice of dispensing, recommending, counseling, and answering the patients’ queries about CMs. CMs recommended most by community pharmacists were vitamins & minerals, food or dietary supplements, fish oil and probiotics. The most common dispensed CMs were vitamins & minerals, herbs, food or dietary supplements, fish oil and essential oils. Lacks of reliable information sources and scientific evidence were common barriers for the CM practices. Being less expensive than conventional medicines motivated the pharmacists to recommend and discuss about CMs. The community pharmacists that participated in included studies suggested strengthening CM trainings and highlight the pharmacist role in CM therapy. Conclusion: A high percentage of community pharmacists did dispense CMs to their patients, while a low percentage of the pharmacists did report CM side effects.

Community pharmacists have a role in ensuring the safe use of HDS, but they have been reported to not being proactive in providing pharmacist care (PCare) for HDS users. The reasons for this warranted investigation. The study aimed to explore pharmacists’ understanding of PCare for HDS users, and to investigate the underlying beliefs or factors influencing its provision by community pharmacists, guided by the theory of planned behaviour. Methods: A qualitative study using a semi-structured interview guide was conducted in a purposive sample of community pharmacists working in Bangkok, Thailand, from December 2016 to June 2017. All interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed and analysed using qualitative content analysis. Key findings: Twenty-two pharmacists were interviewed. Several professional pharmacy activities were regarded as PCare for HDS users. The pharmacists reported that the provision of such care was advantageous in terms of promoting rational use of HDS, ensuring safety of users, enhancing own knowledge and promote customers’ loyalty. Facilitators for PCare included the initiation of conversation about HDS by the users, professional training and the availability of reference materials. The reluctance of HDS users to accept pharmacists’ opinions, insufficient education in HDS and limited sources of information were identified as barriers. Most pharmacists believed that PCare for HDS users is part of their responsibilities. Conclusions: The pharmacists expressed their views on the meaning of PCare for HDS users, and described the beliefs and factors that facilitate or impede its provision. Information from this study can be used to inform strategies that can promote pharmacists to become more proactive in providing PCare for HDS users.']"

Although these tumors behave differently, limited data of their protein expression profiles have been exhibited, particularly at the proteome level. The present study aimed to i.) characterize peptide-mass fingerprints (PMFs) and identify potential protein candidates of OM, OSCC, BN and normal control subjects, using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) and liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), ii.) identify potential protein candidates associated with the diseases, using in-gel digestion coupled with mass spectrometric analysis (GeLC-MS/MS) and iii.) search for relationships between chemotherapy drugs and disease-perturbed proteins. A distinct cluster of each sample group and unique PMFs with identified protein candidates were revealed. The unique peptide fragment at 2,274 Da of sacsin molecular chaperone (SACS) was observed in early-stage OM whereas the fragment at 1,958 Da of sodium voltage-gated channel alpha subunit 10 (SCN10A) was presented in early- and late-stage OM. The peptide mass at 2,316 Da of Notch1 appeared in early-stage OM and benign oral tumors while the peptide mass at 2,505 Da of glutamate ionotropic receptor N-methyl-D-aspartate type subunit 3A (GRIN3A) was identified in all groups. Markedly expressed proteins from GeLC-MS/MS included Jumonji domain containing 1C (JMJD1C) in benign tumors, inversin (INVS) and rho guanine nucleotide exchange factor 28 (ARHGEF28) in OM, BTB domain-containing 16 (BTBD16) in OSCC, and protein tyrosine phosphatase non-receptor type 1 (PTPN1), BRCA2, DNA repair associated (BRCA2), WW domain binding protein 2 (WBP2), purinergic receptor P2Y1 and proteasome activator subunit 4 (PSME4) in all cancerous groups. The network connections between these proteins and chemotherapy drugs, cisplatin and doxorubicin, were also demonstrated.

For disease monitoring and early diagnosis, salivary biomarkers are appropriate because saliva collection is non-invasive and requires no professional skills. In the era of omics, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization with time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) coupled with liquid chromatography-tandem MS (LC-MS/MS) are suitable to identify potential disease-associated peptides and proteins. The present study aimed to use MALDI-TOF MS and LC-MS/ MS to search for particular peptide mass fingerprints (PMFs) and conceivable biomarkers in saliva of dogs with early- and late-stage oral melanoma (EOM and LOM, respectively), oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), benign oral tumors (BN), and periodontitis and healthy controls (CP). Pooled saliva samples in each group were used to be representative of population change. Unique PMFs were obtained and specific peptide fragments were sequenced by LC-MS/MS and BLAST-searched with mammalian protein databases. Seven peptide fragments appeared in the tumor groups (EOM, LOM, OSCC and BN) at 1096, 1208, 1322, 1794, 1864, 2354 and 2483 Da, two peptide fragments appeared in the LOM and OSCC groups at 2450 and 3492 Da, and in the CP controls at 2544 and 3026 Da. Also, protein–chemotherapy drug interaction networks were exhibited. Using western blot analysis, the expression of sentrin-specific protease 7 (SENP7), a peptide fragment at 1096 Da, in OSCC was significantly increased, as was the expression of TLR4, a peptide fragment at 3492 Da, in LOM and OSCC, compared with the CP group. The expression of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB), a TLR4 partner, was notably increased in OSCC compared with CP, BN and EOM. The expression was also enhanced in LOM compared with EOM. Expressed protein sequences from western blots were verified by LC-MS/MS. Western blots were then performed with individual samples in each group. The results showed the elevated expression of TLR4 in LOM and OSCC, compared with that in CP and BN, the increased expression of NF-κB in LOM and OSCC, compared with CP and in LOM compared with BN, and the enhanced expression of SENP7 in LOM and OSCC, compared with that in CP and BN. In conclusion, discrete clusters of EOM, LOM, OSCC, BN and CP groups and potential protein candidates associated with the diseases were demonstrated by salivary proteomics. Western blot analysis verified SENP7, TLR4 and NF-κB as potential salivary biomarkers of canine oral tumors.', 'In-gel digestion coupled with mass spectrometry (GeLC-MS/MS)-based salivary proteomic profiling of canine oral tumors  2020 The Author(s).Background: Various types of oral tumors, either benign or malignant, are commonly found in dogs. Since saliva directly contacts the tumors and saliva collection is non-invasive, easily accessible and cost effective, salivary biomarkers are practical to be used for the diagnosis and/or prognosis of these diseases. However, there is limited knowledge of protein expression in saliva for canine oral tumors. The present study aimed to investigate novel biomarkers from the salivary proteome of dogs with early- and late-stage oral melanoma (EOM and LOM, respectively), oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), benign oral tumors (BN), and periodontitis and healthy controls (CP), using an in-gel digestion coupled with mass spectrometry (GeLC-MS/MS). The relationships between protein candidates and chemotherapy drugs were explored and the expression of potential biomarkers in saliva and tissues was verified by western blot analysis. Results: For saliva samples, increased expression of protein tyrosine phosphatase non-receptor type 5 (PTPN5) was shown in all tumor groups compared with the CP group. Marked expression of PTPN5 was also observed in LOM and OSCC compared with that in BN and EOM. In addition, tumor protein p53 (p53), which appeared in the PTPN5-drug interactions, was exhibited to be expressed in all tumor groups compared with that in the CP group. For tissue samples, increased expression of p53 was shown in LOM compared with the control group. Conclusion: PTPN5 and p53 were proposed to be potential salivary biomarkers of canine oral tumors.']"

Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.The stochastic differential equation (SDE) has been used to model various phenomena and investigate their properties. Conditional moments of stochastic processes can be used to price financial derivatives whose payoffs depend on conditional moments of underlying assets. In general, the transition probability density function (PDF) of a stochastic process is often unavailable in closed form. Thus, the conditional moments, which can be directly computed by applying the transition PDFs, may be unavailable in closed form. In this work, we studied an inhomogeneous nonlinear drift constant elasticity of variance (IND-CEV) process, which is a class of diffusions that have time-dependent parameter functions; therefore, their sample paths are asymmetric. The closed-form formulas for conditional moments of the IND-CEV process were derived without having a condition on eigenfunctions or the transition PDF. The analytical results were examined through Monte Carlo simulations.', 'A Novel Analytical Formula for the Discounted Moments of the ECIR Process and Interest Rate Swaps Pricing  2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.This paper presents an explicit formula of conditional expectation for a product of polynomial functions and the discounted characteristic function based on the Cox–Ingersoll–Ross (CIR) process. We also propose an analytical formula as well as a very efficient and accurate approach, based on the finite integration method with shifted Chebyshev polynomial, to evaluate this expectation under the Extended CIR (ECIR) process. The formulas are derived by solving the equivalent partial differential equations obtained by utilizing the Feynman–Kac representation. In addition, we extend our results to derive an analytical formula of conditional expectation of a product of mixed polynomial functions and the discounted characteristic function. The accuracy and efficiency of the proposed scheme are also numerically shown for various modeling parameters by comparing them with those obtained from Monte Carlo simulations. In addition, to illustrate applications of the obtained formulas in finance, analytical pricing formulas for arrears and vanilla interest rate swaps under the ECIR process are derived. The pricing formulas become explicit under the CIR process. Finally, the fractional ECIR process is also studied as an extended case of our main results.', 'Analytically Pricing Formula for Contingent Claim with Polynomial Payoff under ECIR Process  2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.Contingent claims, such as bonds, swaps, and options, are financial derivatives whose payoffs depend on uncertain future real values of underlying assets which emphasize various real-world applications. In general, valuations for contingent claims can be derived from the conditional expectations of underlying assets. For a simple process, the moments are usually directly obtained from its transition probability density function (PDF). However, if the transition PDF is unavailable in simple form, the derivations of the moments and the contingent claim prices will not be accessible in closed forms. This paper provides a closed-form formula for pricing contingent claims with nonlinear payoff under a no-arbitrage principle when underlying assets follow the extended Cox–Ingersoll– Ross (ECIR) process with the symmetry properties of the Brownian motion. The formula proposed here is a consequence of successfully solving an explicit solution for a system of recurrence partial differential equations in which its solution subtly depends on the conditional moments. For the particular CIR process, we obtain simple closed-form formulas by solving the Riccati differential equation. Furthermore, we carry out a complete investigation of the convergent case for those formulas. In case such as that of the unsolvable Riccati differential equation, ECIR case, a numerical method for numerically evaluating the mentioned analytical formulas and numerical validations for the formulas are examined. The validity and efficiency of the formulas are numerically demonstrated by comparison with results from Monte Carlo simulations for various modeling parameters. Finally, the proposed formula is applied to the value contingent claims such as coupon bonds, interest rate swaps, and arrears swaps.']"

Journal of Clinical Periodontology Published by John Wiley & Sons LtdAim: To determine sequences and magnitude of causality among periodontitis, diabetes and chronic kidney disease (CKD) by mediation analysis. Methods: Ten-year-data were retrieved from the Electric Generation Authority of Thailand (EGAT) study. A cohort of 2,635 subjects was identified with no CKD at baseline. The interested outcome was CKD incidence defined as glomerular filtration rate <60 ml/min/1.73 m2. The percentage of proximal sites with clinical attachment loss ≥5 mm was used to represent periodontitis. Mediation analysis with 1,000-replication bootstrapping was applied to two causal diagrams, diagram A (Periodontitis → Diabetes → CKD) and diagram B (Diabetes → Periodontitis → CKD). Results: The cumulative incidence of CKD was 10.3 cases per 100 persons during 10-year period. In diagram A, each increasing percentage of proximal sites with severe periodontitis increased the adjusted odds ratio of CKD 1.010 (95% CI: 1.005, 1.015) and 1.007 (95% CI: 1.004, 1.013), by direct and indirect effect through diabetes, respectively. In diagram B, diabetes increased the odds of CKD twofold, with 6.5% of this effect mediated via periodontitis. Conclusions: Periodontitis had significant direct effect, and indirect effect through diabetes, on the incidence of CKD.

Materials and methods: This 10-year retrospective cohort study comprised 2216 employees of the Electric Generation Authority of Thailand (EGAT). Their demographic, medical, and periodontal status was collected. Subjects with periodontitis progression were defined as having ≥ 2 teeth with progression. Additional proximal clinical attachment loss ≥ 3 mm or tooth loss with severe periodontitis at baseline were used to identify disease progression at the tooth level. Central obesity was classified using the waist-hip ratio. Multi-level Poisson regression was used to determine the effect of obesity on periodontitis progression by adjusting for age, sex, education, income, smoking, alcohol drinking, exercise, diabetes mellitus, and hypertension. Results: The cumulative incidence of periodontitis progression during the 10-year period was 59.6 cases per 100 persons (95% CI: 57.5, 61.6). The univariate analysis indicated that obese subjects had 15% higher risk of progression than that of healthy subjects. However, when confounders were analyzed simultaneously, the effect of obesity was not significant with a risk ratio of 0.98 (95% CI: 0.88, 1.08). Conclusions: Despite the higher incidence of disease progression in the obese, obesity is not an independent risk factor for periodontitis progression. Clinical relevance: Obesity and periodontitis progression share many common risk factors. Using the obesity as a preliminary screening for periodontitis progression may be an alternative prevention protocol.', 'Metabolic syndrome and severe periodontitis were associated in Thai adults: A cross-sectional study  2021 American Academy of PeriodontologyBackground: Studies support the relationship between metabolic syndrome (MetS) and periodontitis. However, age is the major confounding factor for both conditions. Therefore, this cross-sectional study was performed to investigate the relationship between MetS and severe periodontitis in different Thai adult age groups. Methods: Data on the medical history, medical examination, and full mouth oral examination of 5,690 Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand employees aged 25 to 77 years were collected. The prevalence ratio (PR) between risk variables, MetS, and periodontitis was determined using Poisson regression analysis. Moreover, the subgroup analysis and effect modification by age on severe periodontitis were performed. Results: Overall, MetS was significantly associated with severe periodontitis compared with non-severe periodontitis (adjusted PR, 1.11; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.01 to 1.13). The association was modified by age, with negative effect modification observed on the multiplicative and additive scales. The subgroup analysis revealed a significant relationship between MetS and severe periodontitis only in participants aged <45 years with an adjusted PR of 1.69 (95% CI, 1.29 to 2.21). All MetS components, except hypertension, were associated with severe periodontitis in this group. Conclusions: There is a significant relationship between MetS and severe periodontitis in adults aged <45 years. Therefore, attempts to control the risk of MetS and periodontitis should be emphasized for early adults to reduce the incidence of these conditions and related complications when they become elderly.']"

In this study, spotted babylon protein hydrolysate (SPH) derived from a sequential 3 hour digestion, first with pepsin and then with pancreatin, was examined. SPH was fractionated using molecular weight cut-off membranes for 10 kDa, 5 kDa, 3 kDa, and 0.65 kDa. It was found that the MW < 0.65 kDa fraction provided the greatest levels of 2,2′-azino-bis-3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonic acid (ABTS), 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazl (DPPH), and nitric oxide (NO) radical scavenging activity. Three subfractions of the MW < 0.65 kDa fraction were then generated via RP-HPLC. The subfraction which subsequently demonstrated the greatest free radical scavenging activity was F3, which was accordingly chosen for further investigation commencing with quadrupole-time-of-flight-electron spin induction-mass spectrometry-based de novo peptide sequencing. This resulted in the identification of a pair of novel peptides: His-Thr-Tyr-His-Glu-Val-Thr-Lys-His (HTYHEVTKH), and Trp-Pro-Val-Leu-Ala-Tyr-His-Phe-Thr (WPVLAYHF). The WPVLAYHF peptide exhibited greater antioxidant activity. The study also confirmed that the F3 sub-fraction was able to prevent hydroxyl radicals from causing DNA damage by conducting tests which involved the pKS, pUC19, and pBR322 plasmids using the Fenton reaction. In addition, cellular antioxidant activity was demonstrated by two synthetic peptides toward the human adenocarcinoma colon (Caco-2) cell line, with the potency of the activity dependent upon the peptide concentration.', 'Investigating the cellular antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects of the novel peptides in lingzhi mushrooms  2022 The Author(s)The lingzhi mushroom (Ganoderma lucidum) is well known for its medicinal properties and has long played a role in traditional oriental medicine due to its health-giving benefits and potential to extend life expectancy. The mushroom contains a number of highly bioactive compounds and can also act as an excellent source of protein. This research investigated the peptides obtained from the protein hydrolysates of lingzhi mushrooms to assess their free radical scavenging abilities. These peptides were acquired via different proteases (Alcalase, Neutrase, papain, and pepsin-pancreatin) and were tested at a range of different concentrations (1.0%, 2.5%, and 5.0% w/v). The highest levels of 2,2′-azino-bis-3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid (ABTS), 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and nitric oxide (NO) radical scavenging activities were presented by lingzhi mushroom hydrolysate using 2.5% (w/v) pepsin-pancreatin after 6 h of digestion. The hydrolysate was then fractionated using 10, 5, 3, and 0.65 kDa molecular weight cut-off membranes. The results showed that the MW 0.65 kDa fraction had the highest level of free radical scavenging activity. Further analysis of this MW 0.65 kDa fraction began with another RP-HPLC fractionation technique to obtain three further sub-fractions. De novo peptide sequencing using electrospray ionization quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (ESI-Q-TOF-MS/MS) was chosen as the optimum method for studying the F3 sub-fraction. DRVSIYGWG and ALLSISSF were discovered as new peptides with different antioxidant properties. Adenocarcinoma colon (Caco-2) cells showed the antioxidant action of these synthesized peptides. This activity was linked to peptide concentration. The peptides and their pure synthetic counterparts were found to reduce NO generation by RAW 264.7 macrophages without causing cytotoxicity. The results of gene expression reveal that the DRVSIYGWG and ALLSISSF peptides were able to cut the expression of the proinflammatory cytokine genes iNOS, IL-6, TNF-α, and COX-2 in the context of RAW 264.7 macrophages.', 'The apoptotic and free radical–scavenging abilities of the protein hydrolysate obtained from chicken feather meal  2019This study examined the antioxidant capabilities of peptides derived from chicken feather meal (CFM) protein hydrolysates which were produced using 3 different microbial proteases (Neutrase, Alcalase, and flavourzyme) and tested at varying concentrations, namely 1, 2, and 5% by weight. The highest levels of 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazl (DPPH) and 2,2′-azino-bis-3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulphonic acid (ABTS) radical scavenging activities were presented by CFM hydrolysate derived using 5 wt% Neutrase and digested for 4 h. Fractionation of this particular hydrolysate was then performed by applying 10, 5, 3, and 0.65 kDa molecular weight cutoff membranes. It was then determined that the molecular weight (MW) < 0.65 kDa fraction achieved the greatest level of free radical scavenging activity in the context of DPPH and ABTS. The MW < 0.65 kDa fraction then underwent additional fractionation using reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography to derive 3 main fractions designated as F1, F2, and F3. All of these fractions presented a high level of activity in DPPH radical scavenging, although no significant ABTS scavenging was observed. Quadrupole time-of-flight tandem mass spectrometry was used in determining the peptide contents of the fractions as Phe-Asp-Asp-Arg-Gly-Arg-X for F1 (FDDRGRX, 875 Da), Val-Thr-Leu-Ala-Val-Thr-Lys-His for F2 (VTLAVTKH, 868 Da), and Val-Ser-Glu-Ile-X-Ser-Ile-Pro-Ile-Ser for F3 (VSEIXSIPIS, 1,055 Da). Moreover, the F2 fraction was shown to be capable of preventing DNA damage induced by hydroxyl radicals, as indicated in tests using the plasmids pKS, pUC19, and pBR322 via the Fenton reaction. This outcome was demonstrated through in vitro antiproliferative activity in human cell lines based on SW620 colon cancer, using the 3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide assay. The F2 fraction at 0.5 wt.% was also shown to be capable of inducing weak early apoptosis, which could be measured by using the Fluorescein isothiocyanate Annexin V Apoptosis Detection Kit with Propidium Iodide Solution.

Zeolite-supported nanoscale zero-valent iron (Z-NZVI) coated onto bentonite-zeolite pellets (BZ-NZVI) was prepared for the removal of Se6+. The BZ pellets were coated with Z-NZVI powder at a ratio of 1:5. The BZ-NZVI was characterized using X-ray diffraction, point of zero charge analysis, Brunauer-Emmett-Teller method, field emission scanning electron microscopy, and X-ray fluorescence spectrometry techniques. The BZ-NZVI samples were tested in the batch reactor for kinetics and adsorption isotherm studies and subsequently in a continuous fixed-bed column. The kinetic models and adsorption isotherms were best described by the pseudo-first-order kinetics and Langmuir adsorption isotherm, respectively. Both boundary layer diffusion and intraparticle diffusion appeared to affect the intraparticle diffusion process. The efficiency of Se6+ removal in fixed-bed column of BZ-NZVI fitted well with Yoon-Nelson model. The adsorption rate decreased according to the Se6+ breakthrough proportion. The maximum Se6+ adsorption breakthrough capacity was 0.034 mg/g under the test run of 0.5 mg/L-Se6+ solution, pH 7, the flow rate of 5 mL/min, and the temperature of 303 K.

The As(III) and arsenate (As(V)) removal efficiencies for single fixed-bed columns of K-OMS2 and Fe-BTC, respectively, as well as for the two columns combined, were determined. From the single-column run results, K-OMS2 maintained notable efficiency in oxidizing As(III) to As(V) during a three-round-use cycle, with leached Mn and K concentrations below the groundwater standard. The average As(III) oxidation percentages in K-OMS2 column for 600 min in the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd rounds were 95, 92, and 93%, respectively. In the Fe-BTC single-column run, the Yoon-Nelson model was found to represent the adsorption kinetics model of the run, with a maximum As(V) adsorption capacity of 52.60 mg/g, and more than 75% of As(V) was removed for 600 min. Maximum Fe leaching from Fe-BTC column was 0.23 mg/L, which was lower than Fe concentration range found in natural freshwater. The adsorption behavior can be explained by the fact that the adsorption rate decreased depending on the As(V) breakthrough and Fe-BTC proportion. In the case of two columns combined, more than 62% of the total As was removed over 2200 min of operation time under optimal experimental conditions.']"

To determine the presence of DTMUV in 2007, the clinical samples from affected ducks collected in 2007 were tested for DTMUV using pathological and virological analyses. Gross and histopathological lesions of affected ducks were mostly restricted to the ovary, brain and spinal cord, and correlated with the presence of flavivirus antigen in the brain and spinal cord samples. Subsequently, DTMUV was identified by RT-PCR and nucleotide sequencing of the polyprotein gene. Phylogenetic analysis of the polyprotein gene sequence revealed that the 2007 Thai DTMUV was a unique virus, belonged within DTMUV cluster 1, but distinctively separated from the Malaysian DTMUV, which was the most closely related DTMUV. It is interesting to note that the 2007 Thai DTMUV was genetically different from the currently circulating Thai and Chinese DTMUVs, which belonged to cluster 2. Our findings indicated that the 2007 Thai DTMUV emerged earlier from a common ancestor with the recently reported DTMUVs; however, it was genetically distinctive to any of the currently circulating DTMUVs. In conclusion, our data demonstrated the presence of DTMUV in the Thai ducks since 2007, prior to the first report of DTMUV in China in 2010. This study indicates that DTMUV may have circulated in the region long before 2010 and highlights high genetic diversity of DTMUVs in Asia.', 'Pathogenesis of Thai duck Tembusu virus in Cherry Valley ducks: The effect of age on susceptibility to infection  2020 Elsevier B.V.Several duck Tembusu virus (DTMUV) clusters have been identified since its first emergence in 2010. However, the pathogenesis evaluation of DTMUV has been restricted to cluster 2.2 Chinese DTMUVs. In this study, the pathogenesis of a cluster 2.1 Thai DTMUV was investigated in three ages of Cherry Valley ducks (1-, 4- and 27-week-old). In each age, 35 ducks were inoculated with a cluster 2.1 Thai DTMUV and evaluated for clinical signs, virus distribution and shedding, pathology and serological response. Our results demonstrated that all duck ages were susceptible to Thai DTMUV; however, Thai DTMUV induced greater disease severity in younger ducks (1- and 4-week-old) when compared to older ducks (27-week-old) reflected by higher morbidity and mortality rates, and higher degree of pathological severity. Corresponding to these results, longer-term viremia, higher levels of viral loads in tissues and lower neutralizing antibody titers were also observed in younger ducks compared to those in older ducks. However, it should be noted that a significant drop in egg production was found in older ducks, which also indicates the susceptibility to Thai DTMUV in older ducks. Interestingly, prolonged shedding period with high viral loads was observed in older ducks even without showing clinical signs, suggesting the potential role of the older ducks as the carriers of Thai DTMUV. This finding highlights the importance of monitoring DTMUV and preventing the transmission of DTMUV in adult ducks.

In Thailand, DTMUV has been detected sporadically in ducks since the first report in 2013. However, information on the patterns of DTMUV infection in ducks in Thailand is limited. In this study, a serological survey of DTMUV on ducks raised in farming and free-grazing systems was conducted during 2015-2016. Blood samples of farm ducks (n = 160) and free-grazing ducks (n = 240) were collected in the summer, rainy, and winter seasons during 2015-2016 and tested for DTMUV infection. Our results showed that DTMUV infection in ducks in Thailand occurred all year-round; however, the patterns of DTMUV infection varied between 2 duck-raising systems. Significant seasonal pattern was found in free-grazing ducks, whereas no seasonality was observed in farm ducks. Notably, DTMUV infection in ducks in Thailand was highest in the winter season. In conclusion, our data indicate distinct patterns of DTMUV infection between farm and free-grazing ducks, and the year-round circulation of DTMUV in ducks in Thailand, with peaks in the winter season. This information will help reduce the risk of DTMUV transmission through prevention and control strategies focusing on the peak period. Routine surveillance of DTMUV in ducks is essential for early detection of DTMUV allowing the implementation of control measures in a timely manner.']"

A total of 20 MRSA isolates of 134 Staphylococcus aureus isolated from canine and feline clinical samples during 2017–2020 were CC398, consisting of sequence type (ST) 398 (18 isolates), ST5926 (1 isolate), and ST6563 (1 isolate) by multilocus sequence typing. spa t034 and staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec (SCCmec) V were predominantly associated with ST398. Intraclonal differentiation was present by additional spa (t1255, t4653), non-detectable spa, composite SCCmec with a hybrid of ccrA1B1+ccrC and class A mec complex, and DNA fingerprints by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. The isolates essentially carried antimicrobial resistance genes, mediating multiple resistance to β-lactams (mecA, blaZ), tetracyclines [tet(M)], aminoglycosides [aac(6′)-Ie-aph(2′)-Ia], and trimethoprim (dfr). Livestock-associated MRSA ST398 resistance genes including lnu(B), lsa(E), spw, fexA, and tet(L) were heterogeneously found and lost in subpopulation, with the absence or presence of additional erm(A), erm(B), and ileS2 genes that corresponded to resistance phenotypes.

Sixty-three MRSA isolates were recovered from pigs (n = 60) and humans (n = 3). Two major LA-MRSA lineages, including sequence type (ST) 398 and clonal complex 9 (ST9 and ST4576, a novel single-locus variant of ST9), were identified. ST398 had spa type t034 (n = 55). ST9 and ST4576 had t337 (n = 8) and carried staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec (SCCmec) IX only. MRSA-ST398-t034 contained various SCCmec, including SCCmec V (n = 42), a novel SCCmec composite island (n = 12), and a nontypeable SCCmec (n = 1). All isolates were multidrug resistant and carried common resistance genes found in LA-MRSA. This is the first report of the presence of swine MRSA ST398 and multidrug resistance gene cfr in MRSA ST9 in Thailand. With identical molecular characteristics, pigs could be a source of MRSA ST398 spread to humans. A minor variation of genetic features and resistance gene carriage in both lineages represented a heterogeneous population and evolution of the endemic clones. A monitoring program and farm management, with prudent antimicrobial uses, should be implemented to reduce spreading. Strict hygiene and personal protection are also necessary to prevent transfer of LA-MRSA to humans.', ""Staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec (SCCmec) and characterization of the attachment site (attB) of methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and methicillin susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) isolates  2018 Elsevier LtdThis study was designed to screen for SCCmec types and to characterize the attachment site (attB) and universal insertion site (orfX) of SCCmec in a collection of 27 isolates (n = 11) methicillin resistant S. aureus and (n = 16) methicillin susceptible S. aureus isolates in Malaysia. Screening of SCCmec types and characterization of the attachment site was carried out using PCR amplification and Sanger's sequencing method. The result showed that a large proportion of the MRSA isolates carried SCCmec type III 7/11 (63%). Three isolates 3/11 (27%) and 1/11 (9.0%) carried SCCmec type II and IVd respectively. Amplification of the universal insertion site of the SCCmec (orfX) and attachment site (attB) showed that all 16 S. aureus isolates were positive for the orfX gene, while only 7 were positive for the attB gene. Phylogenetic diversity showed that the isolates clustered around strains with features similar to a community acquired MRSA. In conclusion, a high carriage rate of SCCmec type III was observed. The result also showed that all the S. aureus isolates have the orfX structure; however, not all isolates possesses the attB site on the 3′ end of the orfX region.""]"

All rights reserved.Death acceptance relates to a good death of people. Notably, each culture/religion has its own traditions, beliefs, and practices surrounding death, which has been handed down for centuries. Culture/religion creates not only the meaning of death, but also often influences how people die. To date, the measurement of death acceptance, especially from a religious perspective, has not been widely developed. This research was conducted to develop and psychometrically test the Buddhist Death Acceptance Scale for Cancer, reflecting Buddhists beliefs towards karma, and three characteristics of existence. Using a multistage sampling method, Buddhists diagnosed with cancer from six hospitals in four regions of Thailand were recruited into the study from April 2018 to January 2019. Exploratory factor analysis was conducted in the first group of 300 participants. The final version of the questionnaire had 13 items in two components that explained 45.87% of the variation of the construct. These two dimensions were: 1) acceptance of the natural process of death and 2) preparing for death. Confirmatory factor analysis was performed in with 230 participants. The results showed that the two-dimension construct of the scale fit with the empirical data. The Cronbachs alpha coefficient was 0.82. In conclusion, the Scale demonstrated acceptable psychometric properties to measure death acceptance in Buddhists who are diagnosed with cancer. Nurses and other healthcare professionals can use this scale as a tool for evaluating death acceptance and intervention effectiveness among Thai Buddhists with cancer. In addition, next steps include testing the Scale for use with Thai Buddhists at end-of-life with illnesses other than cancer and translating it into other languages to test for use with Buddhists worldwide.', 'Death Acceptance Process in Thai Buddhist Patients With Life-Limiting Cancer: A Grounded Theory  The Author(s) 2022.Cancer patients with life-limiting illnesses have varied levels of death acceptance pervarious scales.

This study explores the death acceptance process among patients with life-limiting cancer. We used grounded theory methodology. Data were collected through in-depth interviews of 13 patients with cancer in a palliative care setting, and researchers completed field notes. Data were analyzed using constant and comparative methods. Thai Buddhist patients with cancer in palliative care process death acceptance through three dynamic phases: engaging suffering, being open-minded about death, and adhering to Buddhist practices for increasing death consciousness. The death acceptance process described in this study could serve as a guideline to support death acceptance in Thai Buddhist patients with cancer, and other patients with cancer in palliative care, to improve peaceful life and attain good death.', 'Death acceptance from a Thai Buddhist perspective: A qualitative study  2020 Elsevier LtdPurpose: To have more in-depth understanding of death acceptance among patients with terminal cancer in Thailand. Methods: A qualitative descriptive research approach was used to capture the perspectives of patients with terminal cancer about death acceptance. Purposive sampling was used to recruit the participants. A semi-structured interview guide was used during data collection to obtain in-depth interviews with 12 patients diagnosed with terminal cancer. An interpretive descriptive method was used for analyzing data. Analysis of the data for this study was conducted by the analytic team beginning at initial data collection. Results: The findings of this study revealed six major themes relating to death acceptance: 1) perceiving death as a natural part of life; 2) perceiving that death cannot be controlled; 3) thinking that death can come at any time; 4) letting everything go before dying: finding a calmness; 5) additional Buddhist practices: clean living and making merit; and 6) additional means for attaining a peaceful death and peaceful life before death. Conclusion: Understanding death acceptance is important for nurses providing care for patients with terminal cancer in order to find strategies and support for patients to accept death and live peacefully with their family in the time they have left.']"

Methods This cohort study included PD patients from the MycoPDICS database who had fungal peritonitis between July 2015-June 2020. Patient outcomes were analyzed by Kaplan Meier curves and the Log-rank test. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards model regression was used to estimating associations between fungal types and patients’ outcomes. Results The study included 304 fungal peritonitis episodes (yeasts n = 129, hyaline molds n = 122, non-hyaline molds n = 44, and mixed fungi n = 9) in 303 patients. Fungal infections were common during the wet season (p <0.001). Mold peritonitis was significantly more frequent in patients with higher hemoglobin levels, presentations with catheter problems, and positive galactomannan (a fungal cell wall component) tests. Patient survival rates were lowest for non-hyaline mold peritonitis. A higher hazard of death was significantly associated with leaving the catheter in-situ (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] = 6.15, 95%confidence interval [CI]: 2.86–13.23) or delaying catheter removal after the diagnosis of fungal peritonitis (HR = 1.56, 95%CI: 1.00–2.44), as well as not receiving antifungal treatment (HR = 2.23, 95%CI: 1.25–4.01) or receiving it for less than 2 weeks (HR = 2.13, 95%CI: 1.33–3.43). Each additional day of antifungal therapy beyond the minimum 14-day duration was associated with a 2% lower risk of death (HR = 0.98, 95%CI: 0.95–0.999). Conclusion Non-hyaline-mold peritonitis had worse survival. Longer duration and higher daily dosage of antifungal treatment were associated with better survival. Deviations from the 2016 ISPD Peritonitis Guideline recommendations concerning treatment duration and catheter removal timing were independently associated with higher mortality.', 'Phytopathogen transmitted from plant to human causing peritoneal dialysis-associated peritonitis  The Author(s) 2021.We report the first case of peritoneal dialysis (PD)-associated peritonitis due to Sporothrix schenckii, a thermally dimorphic black fungus transmitted from epiphytotic disease. The patient presented with PD-associated peritonitis and fungal colonisation inside the PD catheter’s lumen after an exposing ‘wet contamination’ event with a phytopathogen 11 days prior to the onset of infection. The human pathogen and phytopathogen were confirmed the same species by nucleotide sequences of the internal transcribed spacer and large subunit regions of the ribosomal RNA gene. A ‘wet contamination’ should be closely monitored for an extended period, and a broader spectrum of organisms might lead to peritonitis, particularly in centres with a high prevalence of fungal infection. PD patients and their caregivers should have periodic retraining of aseptic technique and personnel hygiene. We also recommend a long course of antifungal medication in eradicating peritoneal sporotrichosis to prevent unfavourable outcomes and relapsing peritonitis from this organism.']"

However, in-situ hydrogen can be generated from glycerol dehydrogenation and glycerol reforming using metal catalysts. Moreover, ethanol can be co-fed as a hydrogen donor for this reaction and produce ethyl lactate via esterification with lactic acid which is by-product from glycerol conversion. In this study, the promotion effect of Cu partially-substituted Mg1.7Al mixed oxide was investigated on the conversion of glycerol co-fed with bio-ethanol in a PARR-reactor at 180 oC for 4 h without hydrogen feeding. Then, the products were analyzed using GC-MS/TOF. The catalysts were characterized using BET, XRD, XPS, XRF, and TPDRO. As a result of the Mg2AlO based catalyst, the glycerol can be converted to 1,2-propaniol, acetone, and acetaldehyde without ethyl lactate production at this condition. The reduced Cu0.3Mg1.7Al LDH-derived catalyst significantly enhanced the selectivity of 1,2-propandiol and ethyl lactate to 47.3 and 22.8 %. 1,2-Propandiol and ethyl lactate as specialty chemicals were found to be co-produced from co-feeding glycerol and bio-ethanol using the reduced Cu0.3Mg1.7Al LDH-derived catalyst.', 'Integrated glycerol- and ethanol-based chemical synthesis routes using Cu–Mg–Al LDH-derived catalysts without external hydrogen: Intervention of bio-ethanol co-fed with glycerol  2020 Elsevier LtdIn order to secure the feed, a bio-based chemical production plant shall be designed to process more than one bio-based feedstock. However, the process usually requires costly H2 supply. Without H2 feeding, the effects of Cu on Cu0.3Mg1.7Al-LDO catalysts were investigated on the hydrogenolysis of glycerol with and without bio-ethanol co-feeding. As a result, the reduced catalyst dramatically increased the glycerol conversion and gave an apparently-high selectivity of chemicals such as 1,2-propandiol, ethyl lactate, and lactic acid. Apparently, besides as a hydrogen donor, ethanol also acted as a reactant that produced ethyl lactate via the esterification with lactic acid. In summary, Cu2+ and Cu+ sites promoted glycerol dehydration, the oxidation to lactic acid, and the esterification with ethanol to ethyl lactate whereas Cu0 was believed to promote the in-situ hydrogen formation from glycerol reforming.

This study was conducted to (i) determine Cd concentrations in rice collected from households in the area, (ii) assess the Cd exposure and potential health risk (HQ) from rice consumption in local adults and (iii) investigate how the factors of individual characteristics and consumption behavior affect the level of HQ. A total of 159 rice samples were collected from households in all 6 villages of the Mae Tao sub-district for analysis of Cd by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. Biodata information and rice consumption behavior were surveyed from local residents at the same time as rice sample collection. Approximately 19.8% and 19.1% of white rice and sticky rice, respectively, contained total Cd higher than the Codex maximum standard of Cd in rice (0.4 mg kg−1). Locally grown rice contained an average of 1.5 times more Cd than retail rice. Cd exposure from consuming only sticky rice was the highest (2.26 × 10−3 mg kg−1 day−1), followed by the consumption of both types of rice (1.39 × 10−3 mg kg−1 day−1) and the consumption of only white jasmine rice (6.30 × 10−4 mg kg−1 day−1). The highest and lowest average HQ values were found in the only sticky rice consumption pattern (2.263) and the only white rice consumption pattern (0.630), respectively. The potential health risk from Cd in each rice consumption pattern was mainly influenced by the total Cd concentration in rice and the rice ingestion rate.', 'Arsenic health risk assessment related to rice consumption behaviors in adults living in Northern Thailand  2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.The rice consumption behaviors of Thai citizens vary among regions. However, the influence of different consumption patterns on arsenic (As) exposure has never been reported. This study was conducted to investigate the effects of rice consumption behavior on As exposure levels. White rice (n = 96) and sticky rice (n = 63) samples were collected from local households in northern Thailand. The actual rice consumption behavior (type, frequency, and amount of rice consumed) was surveyed from the households where the rice samples were collected and used to calculate individual As exposures. The white rice (2.1%) and sticky rice (6.3%) samples contained inorganic As at higher concentrations than the Codex standard (0.2 mg kg−1). Approximately 58.3% of participants consumed white rice for breakfast and sticky rice for lunch and dinner, while 41.8% of participants consumed only white rice or sticky rice daily. Wide variations of As exposure (1 × 10−4 to 2 × 10−3 mg kg−1 day−1) were found. The average As exposure from only sticky rice consumption and combined rice consumption was 2 times higher than the As exposure from only white rice consumption. The rice ingestion rate was the most important factor affecting the level of As exposure resulting from the white rice–only and combined rice consumption patterns. For the combined rice consumption pattern, 45.7 to 93.5% of the total As exposure was from sticky rice consumption. Regarding individual characteristics, older and lower weight participants tended to consume lower amounts of rice. Thus, lower As exposure and fewer health impacts were found in those participants.', 'Risk assessment of bioaccessible arsenic and cadmium exposure through rice consumption in local residents of the Mae Tao Sub-district, Northwestern Thailand  2018, Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature. Consumption of contaminated rice is a toxin exposure route in Asian populations. Since total concentrations generally overestimate health risks, the objectives of this study were to determine the levels of bioaccessible As and Cd in rice cultivated in the Mae Tao, Tak Province and evaluate their potential health impacts in local adults. In total, 59 locally grown rice samples were analyzed for their total and bioaccessible concentrations. Bioaccessible concentrations were obtained from an in vitro digestion process. Inorganic As concentrations were estimated assuming that 63.2–63.5% of the total As is inorganic As. Rice contained inorganic As (45.2% of white rice and 57.1% of sticky rice) and Cd (51.6% of white rice and 32.1% of sticky rice) levels exceeding the Codex standards. The bioaccessibilities of As (16.3–70.0%) and Cd (Null to 83.7%) in rice varied widely. The concentrations of bioaccessible As, which were 1–1.2 times greater than those of bioaccessible Cd, indicate a higher possibility of As absorption into the human body. Positive significant relationships were found between total and bioaccessible As (R 2 = 0.568 for white rice and R 2 = 0.704 for sticky rice) and Cd (R 2 = 0.874 for white rice and R 2 = 0.862 for sticky rice). The hazard quotient (HQ) of inorganic As exposure accounted for approximately 93.4% of hazard index (HI). Approximately 2–6 in 10,000 residents over a lifetime of 75 years could suffer from cancer as a result of daily rice consumption. Therefore, the consumption of the home-grown rice in this study should be limited.']"

In this study we aimed to determine the activity of individual antibiotics and combinations of antibiotics against coRKP using minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of individual antibiotics and the checkerboard technique, respectively. We used the broth microdilution technique to determine the MIC values for tigecycline, gentamicin, amikacin, fosfomycin, chloramphenicol, meropenem, imipenem, ciprofloxacin and colistin against coRKP. The studied coRKP isolates were obtained from patients treated at Phramongkutklao Hospital in Bangkok, Thailand during January 2016-December 2018. None of the isolates tested were susceptible to meropenem, imipenem, ciprofloxacin or colistin but all the isolates were susceptible to tigecycline, amikacin and gentamicin. During in vitro checkerboard testing, a synergistic effect was seen for the following combinations: fosfomycin plus gentamicin seen in 30% of isolates, fosfomycin plus tigecycline seen in 30% of isolates and tigecycline plus gentamicin seen in 13 % of isolates. In vivo studies are needed to determine if these combinations result in a significantly different outcome than treatment using individual antibiotics. To summarize, there were varying sensitivity to tested antibiotics among tested isolates. The combinations of fosfomycin plus gentamicin and fosfomycin plus tigecycline should be explored further for possible combination therapy of coRKP at the studied institution.', 'In vitro activities of carbapenems in combination with amikacin, colistin, or fosfomycin against carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii clinical isolates  2018 Elsevier Inc.Carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii clinical isolates (n=23) were investigated for carbapenem resistance mechanisms and in vitro activities of carbapenems in combination with amikacin, colistin, or fosfomycin. Major carbapenem resistance mechanism was OXA-23 production. The vast majority of these isolates were OXA-23–producing A. baumannii ST195 and ST542, followed by novel STs, ST1417, and ST1423. The interuption of carO by a novel insertion sequence, ISAba40, was found in two isolates.

Surprisingly, the combination of imipenem and fosfomycin was the most effective in this study against A. baumannii, which is intrinsically resistant to fosfomycin. Imipenem and fosfomycin inhibit cell wall synthesis; therefore, fosfomycin may be an adjuvant and enhance the inhibition of cell wall synthesis of carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii when combined with imipenem.', 'In vitro synergism of azithromycin combination with antibiotics against oxa-48-producing klebsiella pneumoniae clinical isolates  2021 by the authors.

K. pneumoniae carrying blaOXA-48, which plays a broad magnitude of carbapenem susceptibility, is widely concerned. This study aimed to characterize related carbapenem resistance mechanisms and forage for new antibiotic combinations to combat blaOXA-48-carrying K. pneumoniae. Among nine isolates, there were two major clones and a singleton identified by ERIC-PCR. Most isolates were resistant to ertapenem (MIC range: 2–>256 mg/L), but two isolates were susceptible to imipenem and meropenem (MIC range: 0.5–1 mg/L). All blaOXA-48-carrying plasmids conferred carbapenem resistance in Escherichia coli transformants. Two ertapenem-susceptible isolates carried both outer membrane proteins (OMPs), OmpK35 and OmpK36. Lack of at least an OMP was present in imipenem-resistant isolates. We evaluated the in vitro activity of an overlooked antibiotic, azithromycin, in combination with other antibiotics. Remarkably, azithromycin exhibited synergism with colistin and fosfomycin by 88.89% and 77.78%, respectively. Bacterial regrowth occurred after exposure to colistin or azithromycin alone. Interestingly, most isolates were killed, reaching synergism by this combination. In conclusion, the combination of azithromycin and colistin may be an alternative strategy in dealing with blaOXA-48-carrying K. pneumoniae infection during a recent shortage of newly effective antibiotic development.']"

In addition, glycerol was added as a plasticizer to improve the elasticity and water absorption capacity of the film. In this study, BC pellicles were simply deconstructed into fibrils suspension and then reconstructed into films with a supplement of alginate, gelatin and glycerol. The physical appearance of fabricated films resembled native BC but possessed improved ductility, enhanced flexibility, higher water uptake ability and better biocompatibility. The film was found to resist tearing under suture pullout strength in a hydrated state. In vitro cytotoxicity tests showed that the film was cytocompatible. A cell study using a human keratinocyte culture demonstrated enhanced cell adhesion, spreading, and proliferation on the BCAGG film compared with BC/alginate film. The BCAGG film therefore has significant potential for use in biomedical applications, particularly in dermal treatment, skin tissue regeneration, and wound healing.', 'Development of bacterial cellulose/alginate/chitosan composites incorporating copper (II) sulfate as an antibacterial wound dressing  2019Bacterial cellulose (BC) is a biopolymer having unique physical and mechanical properties that widen its usefulness in a diverse range of applications.

To widen its usage as an active wound dressing, BC was incorporated with sodium alginate (AG), chitosan (CS), and copper sulfate (Cu), with an aim of imparting a microstatic or an antimicrobial activity. The structure and properties of the obtained BC/AG/CS-Cu composites were systematically studied. These properties include weight fraction, tensile strength, swelling ratio, and release characteristics of Cu. The obtained BC/AG/CS-Cu composites exhibited antibacterial properties against both gram-positive Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and gram-negative bacteria Escherichia coli (E.coli). Moreover, an indirect cytotoxicity test was used to evaluate whether the obtained composites were safe to use in contact with living cells L929 mouse fibroblasts and human dermal fibroblasts.

All rights reserved.Appropriate wound dressings for maintaining a moist wound environment, inducing re-epithelialization and protection from infection have been widely developed. Recently, many biocompatible polymers and bioactive substances have been extensively used for wound healing applications. In this study, bacterial cellulose film (BC-MPE film) and bacterial cellulose/chitosan film (BC/CH-MPE film) containing 1.56 mg/mL of mangosteen pericarp extract (MPE) were prepared. Antibacterial activity, cytotoxicity, physical and mechanical properties of the dry films were investigated. The BC film with MPE presented non-cytotoxic effect after 20 h of exposure to mouse fibroblast cell line (L929). The prepared films performed carrier of bioactive compounds that exhibited antibacterial activity against bacterial infection in burn wounds. The morphology of the films showed the characteristic of ultra-fine network structures with the entrapment of compounds. In addition, the compact structure was observed due to the rapid moisture loss during vacuum drying process. SEM images also showed that BC/CH-MPE film formed layers with chitosan entrapment causing the film to become thicker than BC-MPE film. The formation of MPE and chitosan in modified films was also confirmed by FTIR. The compact structure of BC/CH-MPE film led to the decrease in cumulative release of xanthone, WVTR and WAC. Moreover, the existence of chitosan in BC layers provided more flexible properties than the non-chitosan film. The chitosan addition demonstrated an influence of barrier film to protect the wound. Therefore, BC and chitosan were considered as suitable candidates for wound dressing material and xanthone content of MPE promoted wound healing as an effective therapeutic agent.']"

Many surgical procedures have been proposed and claim to have good post-operative clinical outcomes. These techniques include direct repair, V–Y flap, turndown flap, peroneus brevis tendon graft, flexor digitorum longus graft, FHL graft, semitendinosus graft, gracilis tendon graft or synthetic material. The two surgical techniques that are widely used include FHL grafting and the combination of FHL grafting plus additional augmentation. This meta-analysis was conducted with the purpose of comparing clinical outcomes of flexor hallucis longus (FHL) grafting and the combination of FHL grafting with additional augmentation techniques in the treatment of chronic Achilles tendon rupture. Methods: Systematic literature searches were conducted on Medline, Embase and Scopus from their inception to April 4, 2019, and proceedings of reference list and scientific meetings were also searched. Relevant clinical studies (e.g., observational, cross-sectional, cohort or randomized controlled trial (RCT)) that reported AOFAS (American Orthopedic Foot Ankle Score) and postoperative complications of either technique were identified. Results: Six studies (N = 68) were included for the analysis of FHL, and six studies (N = 124) were included for analysis of FHL with augmentation. A pooling of mean and standard deviation of preoperative and postoperative AOFAS were 57.09 (3.63), 92.97 (22.67) in FHL group and 66.92 (3.16), 95.25 (4.71) in FHL with additional augmentation group respectively. The pooled UMD of AOFAS in FHL with additional augmentation were 2.28 (−1.86, 6.42) scores higher when compared to the FHL group.

The purpose of this study is to define the localisation of MKH in reference to bony landmarks of the foot, its relationship to plantar neurovascular bundle and to investigate in situ and ex vivo length of FHL tendon in single incision, double incision and minimally invasive techniques. Materials and methods: Foot length was examined in 62 feet of 31 soft cadavers (9 males, 22 females). Various parameters including the relationship between MKH and neurovascular bundle, the distances from MKH to medial malleolus (MM), navicular tuberosity (NT) and the first interphalangeal joint of great toe (IP) were measured. Surface localisation of MKH in relation to a line joining the medial end of plantar flexion crease at the base of great toes (MC) to NT (MC-NT line) was determined. Lengths of FHL tendon graft from three surgical techniques were examined. In situ length was measured in the plantar surface of foot and ex vivo length was measured after tendon was cut from its insertion. Results: The mean length of foot was 230.98 ± 15.35 mm with a statistically significant difference between genders in both sides (p < 0.05). No distance was found between medial plantar neurovascular bundle (MPNVB) and MKH. Mean distance of 17.13 ± 3.55 mm was found between lateral plantar neurovascular bundle (LPNVB) and MKH. MKH was located at a mean distance of 117.11 ± 1.00 mm proximal to IP, 26.28 ± 4.75 mm under NT and 59.58 ± 7.51 mm distal to MM with a statistically significant difference of MKH-IP distance between genders in both sides and MKH-NT in right side. MKH was located anterior to NT (66.1%), at NT (27.4%) and posterior to NT (6.5%) on the MC-NT line. Surface localisation of MKH was 94.75 ± 8.43% of MC-NT line from MC with a perpendicular distance of 25.11 ± 5.37 mm below MC-NT line.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the anatomical knowledge of FHL including the type and location of musculotendinous junction (MTJ), tendinous interconnections (TIC) morphology, its location related to Master Knot of Henry (MKH), and the pattern of TIC distribution. Materials and methods: One hundred and sixty-six legs from 52 embalmed and 31 soft cadavers were assessed. The medial (MB) and lateral (LB) bellies of FHL were identified and traced until the end of the most distal muscle fibre to determine the medial and lateral MTJs. MTJ was classified into four types based on the existence and length of MB and LB: type 1, long LB and shorter MB; type 2, equal length of both bellies; type 3, only LB and no MB; type 4, long MB and shorter LB. Low lying muscle belly was defined as muscle extending beyond the zero point (the point of intersection between distal osseous part of tibia and FHL tendon). The distance between MTJ and zero point was measured. TIC was classified into seven types based on the direction and number of slip: type I, one slip from FHL to flexor digitorum longus (FDL); type II, crossed connection: type III, one slip from FDL to FHL; type IV, no connection; type V, two slip from FHL to FDL; type VI, two slip from FHL to FDL and one slip from FDL to FHL; type VII, two slips from FDL to FHL and one slip from FHL to FDL. The distance between the TIC and MKH was measured. TIC distribution was defined into four types based on slip distribution to lesser toes: type a, distributed to second toe; type b, distributed to second and third toes; type c, distributed to second to fourth toes, and type d, distributed to second to fifth toes. Results: Type 1 and type 3 of MTJ morphology were found in 87.3% and 12.7%, respectively. Low lying LB was detected in 66.13% of cases with a mean distance of 13.10 ± 4.51 mm. All MBs ended proximal to the zero point with a mean distance of –21.99 ± 13.21 mm. Three types of TIC (I, II, V) were identified. The highest frequency was type I (82.93%). In addition, a new type of TIC was depicted in 8.53% of cases. Part of the FHL tendon in this type fused with FDL tendon and the rest extended directly to the first toe. TIC could be located either proximal, distal or at the MKH. The highest prevalence was distal to MKH in 51.67% of cases with a mean distance of 11.23 ± 5.13 mm and 8.73 ± 4.2 mm in low lying and non-low-lying groups, respectively. Four types of slip distribution to lesser toes were defined, mostly in type b. No statistically significant differences were detected among all parameters including genders, sides, and groups. Conclusions: Knowledge of this investigation might enhance the clinical efficacy of tendon harvesting and transfer in foot and ankle surgery.']"

Although there is now established theoretical grounds in favor of quantum annealing over simulated annealing, there remain several limitations of its usefulness and useability in MLE, namely, improving its accuracy by formulating the problem more fully for quantum computers and/or reducing hardware noise which may mask the true solution. Currently, the process of embedding quantum maximum likelihood into the quantum machine reduces the scale of problems available and as of now non-artificial problems in which quantum annealing outperforms simulated annealing are hard to find.', 'Quantum Neural Network model for Token allocation for Course Bidding  2021 IEEE.Quantum computer has shown the advantage over the classical computer to solve some problems using the laws of quantum mechanics.

Its low number of qubits and imperfection from noises restrict running full-scale quantum algorithms on such devices; however, quantum advantages can still be obtained. To achieve quantum advantages from NISQ devices, the hybrid quantum-classical algorithms were introduced. Quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) is a variational hybrid algorithm, which utilizes a NISQ device as a sub-unit for specific tasks and performs most calculations on a classical computer. QAOA provides an approximate solution, with arbitrary precision as the number of operations increases, for optimization problems. In this work we investigate the possibility of applying QAOA to a clustering problem and compare its performance with the classical k-means algorithm. It turns out that the weights in graph connectivity can degrade the algorithm operation and make it more difficult to approximate the solution. We also benchmark the QAOA by comparing the approximated solutions with the exact one obtained from a classical clustering algorithm.']"

Prevention of S-AKI is difficult because by the time patients seek medical attention, most have already developed acute kidney injury. Thus, early recognition is crucial to provide supportive treatment and limit further insults. Current diagnostic criteria for acute kidney injury has limited early detection; however, novel biomarkers of kidney stress and damage have been recently validated for risk prediction and early diagnosis of acute kidney injury in the setting of sepsis. Recent evidence shows that microvascular dysfunction, inflammation, and metabolic reprogramming are 3 fundamental mechanisms that may play a role in the development of S-AKI. However, more mechanistic studies are needed to better understand the convoluted pathophysiology of S-AKI and to translate these findings into potential treatment strategies and add to the promising pharmacologic approaches being developed and tested in clinical trials.', 'Innovations in Intensive Care Nephrology  The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2022.Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a sudden loss of kidney function that results in the accumulation of urea and other nitrogenous waste products as well as abnormal control of extracellular fluid volume and electrolytes. With rising incidence worldwide among critically ill patients, AKI is associated with an increased risk of both short-term and long-term mortality. During the past decade, many advances in the field of critical care nephrology have occurred including innovations in setting standard criteria for diagnosis and staging of AKI (Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes, KDIGO 2012 criteria). These criteria do not only unify the diagnostic criteria but also emphasizes the important of early AKI detection. With the delay in rising of serum creatinine after kidney injury, the discovery of novel AKI biomarkers such as neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin, or tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-2 and insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 7 has filled the gap of early AKI detection. Most AKI patients requiring renal support die due to multiple-organ failure, not renal dysfunction. Novel technologies in renal replacement therapy and blood purification will support hemodynamic instability and may improve outcome. Survivors from severe AKI have the consequences including incident chronic kidney disease (CKD), CKD progression, end stage renal disease. The multidisciplinary care team may improve those complication.

Tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-2 and insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 7, urinary biomarkers of cell-cycle arrest, and indicators of kidney stress can detect acute kidney injury before clinical manifestations. We sought to determine the event rates for acute kidney injury as a function of serial measurements of urinary (tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-2)•(insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 7) in patients at risk of sepsis-associated acute kidney injury, so that an escalating series of kidney-sparing sepsis bundles based on international guidelines could be applied. DESIGN: We described the study protocol of ""Limiting acute kidney injury Progression In Sepsis,"" a phase 4, multicenter, adaptive, randomized controlled trial. We performed simulations to estimate the rates for the trial\'s primary endpoint using patient-level data from two previous studies (Sapphire and Protocolized Care for Early Septic Shock). SETTING: Academic and community ICUs. PATIENTS: Critically ill patients with sepsis or septic shock, without evidence of stage 2/3 acute kidney injury at enrollment. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Our primary endpoint is progression of two or more stages of acute kidney injury, death, or dialysis within 72 hours after enrollment. In the Sapphire simulation, 45 of 203 patients (22%) with sepsis met the endpoint. In Protocolized Care for Early Septic Shock, 144 of 607 patients (24%) with septic shock met the endpoint. In both simulations, (tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-2)•(insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 7) patterns, suggested by Limiting acute kidney injury Progression In Sepsis protocol, stratified the risk for the endpoint from 6% (three negative tests) to 41% (for patients eligible for the highest level of kidney-sparing sepsis bundle) in Sapphire, and 14% (two negative tests) to 46% (for the highest level of kidney-sparing sepsis bundle) in Protocolized Care for Early Septic Shock. CONCLUSIONS: Findings of our Limiting acute kidney injury Progression In Sepsis trial simulation confirmed that (tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-2)•(insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 7) could identify patients with different rates of progression to moderate/severe acute kidney injury, death, or dialysis in 72 hours. The Limiting acute kidney injury Progression In Sepsis protocol algorithm is therefore feasible in terms of identifying suitably high-risk individuals for kidney-sparing sepsis bundle.']"

Ethylene is considered as the main phytohormone that regulates the ripening of climacteric fruits. Concomitantly, several ethylene-responsive transcription factors (TFs) are pivotal components of the regulatory network underlying fruit ripening. Calmodulin-binding transcription activator (CAMTA) is one such ethylene-induced TF implicated in various stress and plant developmental processes. Results: Our comprehensive analysis of the CAMTA gene family in Durio zibethinus (durian, Dz) identified 10 CAMTAs with conserved domains. Phylogenetic analysis of DzCAMTAs, positioned DzCAMTA3 with its tomato ortholog that has already been validated for its role in the fruit ripening process through ethylene-mediated signaling. Furthermore, the transcriptome-wide analysis revealed DzCAMTA3 and DzCAMTA8 as the highest expressing durian CAMTA genes. These two DzCAMTAs possessed a distinct ripening-associated expression pattern during post-harvest ripening in Monthong, a durian cultivar native to Thailand. The expression profiling of DzCAMTA3 and DzCAMTA8 under natural ripening conditions and ethylene-induced/delayed ripening conditions substantiated their roles as ethylene-induced transcriptional activators of ripening. Similarly, auxin-suppressed expression of DzCAMTA3 and DzCAMTA8 confirmed their responsiveness to exogenous auxin treatment in a time-dependent manner. Accordingly, we propose that DzCAMTA3 and DzCAMTA8 synergistically crosstalk with ethylene during durian fruit ripening. In contrast, DzCAMTA3 and DzCAMTA8 antagonistically with auxin could affect the post-harvest ripening process in durian. Furthermore, DzCAMTA3 and DzCAMTA8 interacting genes contain significant CAMTA recognition motifs and regulated several pivotal fruit-ripening-associated pathways. Conclusion: Taken together, the present study contributes to an in-depth understanding of the structure and probable function of CAMTA genes in the post-harvest ripening of durian.', 'Genome-wide identification and expression profiling of durian CYPome related to fruit ripening  2021 Suntichaikamolkul et al.

Accordingly, understanding durian fruit ripening is an important factor in its market worldwide, owing to the fact that it is a climacteric fruit with a strikingly limited shelf life. However, knowledge regarding the molecular regulation of durian fruit ripening is still limited. Herein, we focused on cytochrome P450, a large enzyme family that regulates many biosynthetic pathways of plant metabolites and phytohormones. Deep mining of the durian genome and transcriptome libraries led to the identification of all P450s that are potentially involved in durian fruit ripening. Gene expression validation by RT-qPCR showed a high correlation with the transcriptome libraries at five fruit ripening stages. In addition to aril-specific and ripening-associated expression patterns, putative P450s that are potentially involved in phytohormone metabolism were selected for further study. Accordingly, the expression of CYP72, CYP83, CYP88, CYP94, CYP707, and CYP714 was significantly modulated by external treatment with ripening regulators, suggesting possible crosstalk between phytohormones during the regulation of fruit ripening. Interestingly, the expression levels of CYP88, CYP94, and CYP707, which are possibly involved in gibberellin, jasmonic acid, and abscisic acid biosynthesis, respectively, were significantly different between fastand slow-post-harvest ripening cultivars, strongly implying important roles of these hormones in fruit ripening. Taken together, these phytohormone-associated P450s are potentially considered additional molecular regulators controlling ripening processes, besides ethylene and auxin, and are economically important biological traits.', 'Auxin Response Factor 2A Is Part of the Regulatory Network Mediating Fruit Ripening Through Auxin-Ethylene Crosstalk in Durian  Copyright  2020 Khaksar and Sirikantaramas.Fruit ripening is a highly coordinated developmental process driven by a complex hormonal network. Ethylene is the main regulator of climacteric fruit ripening. However, a putative role of other key phytohormones in this process cannot be excluded. We previously observed an increasing level of auxin during the post-harvest ripening of the durian fruit, which occurred concomitantly with the rise in the climacteric ethylene biosynthesis. Herein, we connect the key auxin signaling component, auxin response factors (ARFs), with the regulatory network that controls fruit ripening in durian through the identification and functional characterization of a candidate ripening-associated ARF. Our transcriptome-wide analysis identified 15 ARF members in durian (DzARFs), out of which 12 were expressed in the fruit pulp. Most of these DzARFs showed a differential expression, but DzARF2A had a marked ripening-associated expression pattern during post-harvest ripening in Monthong, a commercial durian cultivar from Thailand. Phylogenetic analysis of DzARF2A based on its tomato orthologue predicted a role in ripening through the regulation of ethylene biosynthesis. Transient expression of DzARF2A in Nicotiana benthamiana leaves significantly upregulated the expression levels of ethylene biosynthetic genes, pointing to a ripening-associated role of DzARF2A through the transcriptional regulation of ethylene biosynthesis. Dual-luciferase reporter assay determined that DzARF2A trans-activates durian ethylene biosynthetic genes. We previously reported significantly higher auxin level during post-harvest ripening in a fast-ripening cultivar (Chanee) compared to a slow-ripening one (Monthong). DzARF2A expression was significantly higher during post-harvest ripening in the fast-ripening cultivars (Chanee and Phuangmanee) compared to that of the slow-ripening ones (Monthong and Kanyao). Thus, higher auxin level could upregulate the expression of DzARF2A during ripening of a fast-ripening cultivar. The auxin-induced expression of DzARF2A confirmed its responsiveness to exogenous auxin treatment in a dose-dependent manner, suggesting an auxin-mediated role of DzARF2A in fruit ripening. We suggest that high DzARF2A expression would activate ARF2A-mediated transcription of ethylene biosynthetic genes, leading to increased climacteric ethylene biosynthesis (auxin-ethylene crosstalk) and faster ripening. Hence, we demonstrated DzARF2A as a new component of the regulatory network possibly mediating durian fruit ripening through transcriptional regulation of ethylene biosynthetic genes.']"

Most current methods require sophisticated laboratory instruments and specialists to provide reliable, cost-effective, specific, and sensitive POC testing for COVID-19 diagnosis. Here, a smartphone-assisted Sensit Smart potentiostat (PalmSens) was integrated with a paper-based electrochemical sensor to detect severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). A disposable paper-based device was fabricated, and the working electrode directly modified with a pyrrolidinyl peptide nucleic acid (acpcPNA) as the biological recognition element to capture the target complementary DNA (cDNA). In the presence of the target cDNA, hybridization with acpcPNA probe blocks the redox conversion of a redox reporter, leading to a decrease in electrochemical response correlating to SARS-CoV-2 concentration. Under optimal conditions, a linear range from 0.1 to 200 nM and a detection limit of 1.0 pM were obtained. The PNA-based electrochemical paper-based analytical device (PNA-based ePAD) offers high specificity toward SARS-CoV-2 N gene because of the highly selective PNA-DNA binding. The developed sensor was used for amplification-free SARS-CoV-2 detection in 10 nasopharyngeal swab samples (7 SARS-CoV-2 positive and 3 SARS-CoV-2 negative), giving a 100% agreement result with RT-PCR.', 'Paper-based electrochemical biosensor for diagnosing COVID-19: Detection of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and antigen  2020 Elsevier B.V.Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is emerging as a global pandemic outbreak. To date, approximately one million deaths and over 32 million cases have been reported. This ongoing pandemic urgently requires an accurate testing device that can be used in the field in a fast manner. Serological assays to detect antibodies have been proven to be a great complement to the standard method of reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), particularly after the second week of infection. We have developed a specific and sensitive immunosensor for immunoglobulin detection produced against SARS-CoV-2. Unlike other lateral flow-based assays (LFAs) involving the utilization of multiple antibodies, we have reported a label-free paper-based electrochemical platform targeting SARS-CoV-2 antibodies without the specific requirement of an antibody. The presence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies will interrupt the redox conversion of the redox indicator, resulting in a decreased current response. This electrochemical sensor was proven effective in real clinical sera from patients with satisfactory results. In addition, the proposed format was also extended to antigen detection (the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2), which presents new possibilities for diagnosing COVID-19.', 'Alternative platform for COVID-19 diagnosis based on AuNP-modified lab-on-paper  2023 The Royal Society of Chemistry.COVID-19 has caused global health problems, and so rapid diagnosis is crucial to slow spread of the disease. Herein, a novel lab-on-paper screening method for SARS-CoV-2 Omicron BA.2 variant was developed using a gold nanoparticle-based colorimetric biosensor along with sensitive detection of SARS-CoV-2 antigen using laser desorption ionization-mass spectrometry (LDI-MS). As a result of antigen-antibody interaction, in the presence of SARS-CoV-2 antigen the gold nanoparticles undergo aggregation and change color from red to light purple, allowing for rapid determination of SARS-CoV-2 antigen with the naked eye. Furthermore, the lab-on-paper method can be directly applied as a substrate for sensitive quantitation of SARS-CoV-2 antigen in saliva using LDI-MS without the use of a conventional organic matrix and sample preparation. LDI-MS offers early diagnosis with high sensitivity, rapidity without sample preparation and lower cost per test compared with reverse transcriptase-PCR, which is crucial for preventing mortality in patients with underlying conditions. This method showed linearity over 0.01-1 μg mL−1 covering the cut-off value of 0.048 μg mL−1 for COVID-19 detection in human saliva. Moreover, a colorimetric sensor for urea was also fabricated in-parallel, for prediction of COVID-19 severity in patients with chronic kidney disease. The color change upon increasing urea concentration directly reflected kidney damage, which is related to increasing risk of mortality among patients with COVID-19. Hence, this platform might be a potential device for non-invasive diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 Omicron BA.2 variant, which is the variant of most concern because it is transmitted more rapidly than the original SARS-CoV-2 virus and the Delta variant.']"

Derangement of the brainstem modulating system, especially raphe nuclei may contribute to this hyperexcitability. The present study aimed to investigate the involvement of the nucleus raphe magnus (NRM) in the development of cortical and trigeminal hyperexcitability in a rat model of MOH. Results: Chronic treatment with acetaminophen increased the frequency of cortical spreading depression (CSD) and the number of c-Fos-immunoreactive (Fos-IR) neurons in the trigeminal nucleus caudalis (TNC). In the control group, muscimol microinjected into the NRM increased significantly the frequency of CSD-evoked direct current shift and Fos-IR neurons in the TNC. This facilitating effect was not found in rats with chronic acetaminophen exposure. In a model of migraine induced by intravenous systemic infusion of nitroglycerin (NTG), rats with chronic exposure to acetaminophen exhibited significantly more frequent neuronal firing in the TNC and greater Fos-IR than those without the acetaminophen treatment. Muscimol microinjection increased neuronal firing in the TNC in control rats, but not in acetaminophen-treated rats. The number of Fos-IR cells in TNC was not changed significantly.

Botulinum toxin type A (BTXA) was found to be effective in migraine prevention. However, the mechanism of action in patients was unknown.

Conclusion: BTXA pretreatment reduced CGRP production and release from the TG leading to lessen CSD production and persistent activation of TNC which played a major role in migraine headache.', 'Deciphering migraine pain mechanisms through electrophysiological insights of trigeminal ganglion neurons  2023, Springer Nature Limited.Migraine is a complex neurological disorder that affects millions of people worldwide. Despite extensive research, the underlying mechanisms that drive migraine pain and related abnormal sensation symptoms, such as hyperalgesia, allodynia, hyperesthesia, and paresthesia, remain poorly understood. One of the proposed mechanisms is cortical spreading depression (CSD), which is believed to be involved in the regulation of trigeminovascular pathways by sensitizing the pain pathway. Another mechanism is serotonin depletion, which is implicated in many neurological disorders and has been shown to exacerbate CSD-evoked pain at the cortical level. However, the effects of CSD and serotonin depletion on trigeminal ganglion neurons, which play a critical role in pain signal transmission, have not been thoroughly studied. In this study, we aimed to investigate the association between CSD and serotonin depletion with peripheral sensitization processes in nociceptive small-to-medium (SM) and large (L) -sized trigeminal ganglion neurons at the electrophysiological level using rat models. We divided the rats into four groups: the control group, the CSD group, the serotonin depletion group, and the CSD/serotonin depletion group. We induced CSD by placing KCl on a burr hole and serotonin depletion by intraperitoneal injection of PCPA (para-chlorophenoxyacetic acid). We then isolated trigeminal ganglion neurons from all groups and classified them according to size. Using patch-clamp recording, we recorded the excitability parameters and action potential (AP) properties of the collected neurons. Our results showed that in SM-sized trigeminal ganglion neurons, the CSD-SM and CSD/serotonin depletion groups had a higher positive resting membrane potential (RMP) than the control-SM group (p = 0.001 and p = 0.002, respectively, post-hoc Tukey’s test). In addition, the gap between RMP and threshold in the CSD-SM group was significantly narrower than in the control-SM group (p = 0.043, post-hoc Tukey’s test). For L-sized neurons, we observed prolongation of the AP rising time, AP falling time, and AP duration in neurons affected by CSD (p < 0.05, pairwise comparison test). In conclusion, our study provides new insights into the underlying mechanisms of migraine pain and abnormal somatosensation. CSD and serotonin depletion promote the transmission of pain signals through the peripheral sensitization process of nociceptive small-to-medium-sized trigeminal ganglion neurons, as well as nociceptive and non-nociceptive large-sized trigeminal ganglion neurons.']"

The porous DPNR films were fabricated from the internal formation of surfactant micelles and their subsequent leaching out to generate porous structures. The pore size of DPNR films increased with increasing surfactant amount. The model drugs were naproxen and indomethacin; their releases and release-permeations were investigated under the effects of surfactant amount, electrical potential, and drug size. Without electric field, the drug release mechanism was mainly driven by concentration gradient. The higher amount of drug released was obtained from the matrix with a larger pore size. Under electric field, the higher amounts of drug release were obtained in the shorter drug release durations, via the electrorepulsive force between the negatively charged drugs and the cathode electrode. The molecular drug size was a factor for the drug absorption, release rate and amount. For the drug release-permeation experiment through the pig skin, there were two release-permeation periods as governed by the combination of concentration gradient and swelling in the first period, and the matrix erosion in the second period. The fabricated porous DPNR films have been shown here to be potential to be used as a transdermal patch with electrically controllable drug release rate, amount and duration along with the facile drug-matrix loading and absorption.', 'Effects of conductive polyazulene and plasticizer embedded in deproteinized natural rubber transdermal patch on electrically controlled naproxen release-permeation  2019 Elsevier B.V. Naproxen (Npx) was utilized as an anionic drug and loaded in the deproteinized natural rubber (DPNR) films prepared by the UV irradiation. The in-vitro drug release-permeation from the DPNR films and through the pig skin was investigated under the effects of the plasticizer type and amount, silicone oil (Si) and dibutyl phthalate (DBP), applied electric potential, and used conductive polyazulene as the drug encapsulation host. The drug release-permeation consisted of 2 successive periods: the pore formation period and release-permeation period. In the first period, the scaling exponent n 1 values were between 0.5 and 1 indicating the decreasing drug rate with time. In the second stage, the scaling exponent n 2 values were higher than 1 indicating the increasing drug rate with time. The Npx release-permeation amount increased with increasing amount of hydrophilic plasticizers. The efficiency of plasticizers on the Npx release-permeation amount was ranked as follows: DBP > Si. The Npx release-permeation amount was drastically enhanced from the applied electrical potential due to the electro-repulsive force between the negatively charged drug and the negatively charged electrode, and the presence of the Npx-doped conductive polyazulene. Other characteristics were also investigated in details namely the matrix morphology, and the pore formation during the two periods.']"

This study created a thin bioactive oxide film on Ti dental implants via oxygen plasma immersion ion implantation (OPIII) to improve bone cell differentiation and osseointegration. OPIII treatment was performed using low (1016 ions/cm2) and high (4 × 1017 ions/cm2) doses of oxygen ions. The Ti surfaces were characterized in terms of topography, wettability, chemical composition, and crystal structure. The differentiation of human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells on OPIII-treated Ti surfaces was evaluated in vitro in terms of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity (early stage marker) and von Kossa staining (late stage marker). The osseointegration of OPIII-treated screw-type Ti dental implants in the femur of rabbits was evaluated in vivo using scanning electron microscope/backscattered electron imaging and histological staining at 4 weeks after implantation. OPIII treatment could induce a Ti oxide film on Ti surface without altering the surface topography, roughness or wettability. Higher oxygen ions dose increased the thickness of the surface Ti oxide film as well as the proportion of rutile phase titanium dioxide (TiO2) in the Ti oxide film. The OPIII-treated Ti surfaces presented higher ALP expression level, stronger von Kossa staining signal, and higher bone-to-implant contact. Note that all of these effects were more pronounced on surfaces created using higher oxygen ions dose due to the higher proportion of rutile phase TiO2. Overall, our results indicate that OPIII treatment using higher oxygen ions dose can enhance the in vitro bone cell differentiation and in vivo osseointegration of Ti dental implants.', 'Effect of plasma-nitrided titanium on mechanical properties and initial cell adhesion  2023Titanium alloy has been widely used as an implantable material with good biocompatibility and mechanical properties. Particularly, the titanium alloy Ti-6Al-4V with surface modification has been utilized in dental applications for decades. In this study, the plasma-based ion implantation (PBII) technique was applied on the surface of Ti-6Al-4V under gaseous mixtures of N2 and Ar with a flow rate of 30 sccm and 5 sccm, respectively. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) showed that the titanium nitrided layer was formed on the surface of Ti-6Al-4V at the peak of 397 eV for N 1s. The effects of plasma nitride on the Ti-6Al-4V were creating a smooth surface with hydrophilic property (RRMS = 17.93 ± 0.05 nm, θ = 61.4° ± 0.36) and increasing surface hardness by ∼42%. Direct culturing with the primary human alveolar bone cells, the plasma-nitrided Ti-6Al-4V improved cell proliferation (4 and 7 days) and showed no cytotoxicity. The DAPI/rhodamine-phalloidin staining and the scanning electron microscope (SEM) were used to examine cellular morphology and initial cell adhesion. The result demonstrated that the plasma nitride enhanced the human alveolar bone cell adhesion compared with glass slides. Overall, plasma-nitridation with nitrogen and argon on Ti-6Al-4V using the PBII technique enhanced surface properties of Ti-6Al-4V and induced adhesion and proliferation of primary human alveolar bone cells, proposing that it can be a potential surface modification for dental application.', 'Effect of ethanol on hydrophilicity of the anodized films performed by two-step anodization at low current density  2019, Chulalognkorn University.Dental implants are usually made from commercially pure titanium or its alloys. The aim of this research was to evaluate the influence of the ethanol addition in 1 M H3PO4 as an electrolyte on hydrophilicity of the anodized films. Ti-6Al-4V alloy plates were modified using two-step anodization at a low current density of 2 mA cm-2 in 1 M H3PO4 with addition of used as an electrolyte. Surface oxide properties were characterized by using various surface analytic techniques, including Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscope (FE-SEM), Atomic Force Microscope (AFM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and contact angle measurement. The non-treated Ti-6Al-4V and the anodized films formed by one-step anodization were used as control samples. A significant increase in hydrophilicity (p < 0.05) was observed on the anodized films formed in H3PO4 with addition of 80%v/v ethanol via two-step anodization due to the formation of rough surface, hydroxyl groups (OH-) and adsorbed molecular water (H2O). The enhanced hydrophilicity could be explained by both the surface chemistry and surface topography of the anodized films.']"

While state-of-the-art image super-resolution models are based on the well-known convolutional neural network (CNN), many self-attention-based or transformer-based experiment attempts have been conducted and have shown promising performance on vision problems. A powerful baseline model based on the swin transformer adopts the shifted window approach. It enhances the capability by restricting the model to compute the self-attention function only on non-superimpose local windows while enabling cross-window relations. However, the architecture design is manually fixed. Therefore, the results are not achieving optimal performance.

As such, analysis of cellular and secreted protein (proteome and secretome) after a single LPS activation and LPS tolerance in macrophages from Ezh2 null (Ezh2flox/flox; LysM-Crecre/−) mice (Ezh2 null) and the littermate control mice (Ezh2fl/fl; LysM-Cre−/−) (Ezh2 control) compared with the unstimulated cells from each group indicated fewer activities in Ezh2 null macrophages, especially by the volcano plot analysis. Indeed, supernatant IL-1β and expression of genes in pro-inflammatory M1 macrophage polarization (IL-1β and iNOS), TNF-α, and NF-κB (a transcription factor) were lower in Ezh2 null macrophages compared with the control. In LPS tolerance, downregulated NF-κB compared with the control was also demonstrated in Ezh2 null cells. In CLP sepsis mice, those with CLP alone and CLP at 2 days after twice receiving LPS injection, representing sepsis and sepsis after endotoxemia, respectively, symptoms were less severe in Ezh2 null mice, as indicated by survival analysis and other biomarkers. However, the Ezh2 inhibitor improved survival only in CLP, but not LPS with CLP. In conclusion, an absence of Ezh2 in macrophages resulted in less severe sepsis, and the use of an Ezh2 inhibitor might be beneficial in sepsis.', 'The Regulatory Roles of Ezh2 in Response to Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in Macrophages and Mice with Conditional Ezh2 Deletion with LysM-Cre System  2023 by the authors.The responses of macrophages to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) might determine the direction of clinical manifestations of sepsis, which is the immune response against severe infection. Meanwhile, the enhancer of zeste homologue 2 (Ezh2), a histone lysine methyltransferase of epigenetic regulation, might interfere with LPS response. Transcriptomic analysis on LPS-activated wild-type macrophages demonstrated an alteration of several epigenetic enzymes. Although the Ezh2-silencing macrophages (RAW264.7), using small interfering RNA (siRNA), indicated a non-different response to the control cells after a single LPS stimulation, the Ezh2-reducing cells demonstrated a less severe LPS tolerance, after two LPS stimulations, as determined by the higher supernatant TNF-α. With a single LPS stimulation, Ezh2 null (Ezh2flox/flox; LysM-Crecre/−) macrophages demonstrated lower supernatant TNF-α than Ezh2 control (Ezh2fl/fl; LysM-Cre−/−), perhaps due to an upregulation of Socs3, which is a suppressor of cytokine signaling 3, due to the loss of the Ezh2 gene. In LPS tolerance, Ezh2 null macrophages indicated higher supernatant TNF-α and IL-6 than the control, supporting an impact of the loss of the Ezh2 inhibitory gene. In parallel, Ezh2 null mice demonstrated lower serum TNF-α and IL-6 than the control mice after an LPS injection, indicating a less severe LPS-induced hyper-inflammation in Ezh2 null mice. On the other hand, there were similar serum cytokines after LPS tolerance and the non-reduction of serum cytokines after the second dose of LPS, indicating less severe LPS tolerance in Ezh2 null mice compared with control mice. In conclusion, an absence of Ezh2 in macrophages resulted in less severe LPS-induced inflammation, as indicated by low serum cytokines, with less severe LPS tolerance, as demonstrated by higher cytokine production, partly through the upregulated Socs3.', 'Less Severe Lipopolysaccharide-Induced Inflammation in Conditional mgmt-Deleted Mice with LysM-Cre System: The Loss of DNA Repair in Macrophages  2023 by the authors.Despite the known influence of DNA methylation from lipopolysaccharide (LPS) activation, data on the O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT, a DNA suicide repair enzyme) in macrophages is still lacking. The transcriptomic profiling of epigenetic enzymes from wild-type macrophages after single and double LPS stimulation, representing acute inflammation and LPS tolerance, respectively, was performed. Small interfering RNA (siRNA) silencing of mgmt in the macrophage cell line (RAW264.7) and mgmt null (mgmtflox/flox; LysM-Crecre/−) macrophages demonstrated lower secretion of TNF-α and IL-6 and lower expression of pro-inflammatory genes (iNOS and IL-1β) compared with the control. Macrophage injury after a single LPS dose and LPS tolerance was demonstrated by reduced cell viability and increased oxidative stress (dihydroethidium) compared with the activated macrophages from littermate control mice (mgmtflox/flox; LysM-Cre−/−). Additionally, a single LPS dose and LPS tolerance also caused mitochondrial toxicity, as indicated by reduced maximal respiratory capacity (extracellular flux analysis) in the macrophages of both mgmt null and control mice. However, LPS upregulated mgmt only in LPS-tolerant macrophages but not after the single LPS stimulation. In mice, the mgmt null group demonstrated lower serum TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-10 than control mice after either single or double LPS stimulation. Suppressed cytokine production resulting from an absence of mgmt in macrophages caused less severe LPS-induced inflammation but might worsen LPS tolerance.']"

Multivariate logistic regression revealed two significant findings in differentiating between DD and non-DD, including M line at defecation (OR 23.31, 95% CI 3.10–175.32) and ARA at defecation (OR 13.63, 95% CI 1.94–95.53) with sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV and AUC of 79.2%, 95.5%, 95%, 80.8% and 0.87(95% CI 0.78–0.97), respectively. Conclusion: MR defecography has high diagnostic performance in diagnosis of DD. Although M line and ARA at defecation are two significant findings on multivariate analysis, ARA change less than 1.5 degrees and prominent puborectalis muscle have good specificity in DD diagnosis. Graphical abstract: [Figure not available: see fulltext.]', 'Cortico-anorectal, Spino-anorectal, and Cortico-spinal Nerve Conduction and Locus of Neuronal Injury in Patients With Fecal Incontinence  2019 AGA InstituteBackground & Aims: The neuropathophysiology of fecal incontinence (FI) is incompletely understood. We examined the efferent brain-anorectal and spino-anorectal motor-evoked potentials (MEP) to characterize the locus of neuronal injury in patients with FI. Methods: We performed bilateral transcranial, translumbar, and transsacral magnetic stimulations in 27 patients with FI (19 female) and 31 healthy individuals (controls, 20 female) from 2015 through 2017. MEPs were recorded simultaneously from the rectum and anus using 4 ring electrodes. The difference in MEP latencies between the transcranial (TMS) and translumbar transsacral magnetic stimulations was calculated as cortico-spinal conduction time. MEP data were compared between patients with FI and controls. Patients filled out questionnaires that assessed the severity and effects of FI. Results: The MEP latencies with TMS were significantly longer in patients with FI than controls at most sites, and on both sides (P <.05). Almost all translumbar and transsacral MEP latencies were significantly prolonged in patients with FI vs controls (P <.01). The cortico-spinal conduction time were similar, on both sides, between patients with FI and controls. Ninety-three percent of patients had 1 or more abnormal translumbar and transsacral latencies, but neuropathy was patchy and variable, and not associated with sex or anal sphincter function or defects. Conclusions: Patients with FI have significant neuropathy that affects the cortico-anorectal and spino-anorectal efferent pathways. The primary loci are the lumbo-rectal, lumbo-anal, sacro-rectal, and sacro-anal nerves; the cortico-spinal segment appears intact. Peripheral spino-anal and spino-rectal neuropathy might therefore contribute to the pathogenesis of FI.', 'Factors Associated With Response to Biofeedback Therapy for Dyssynergic Defecation  2018 AGA InstituteBackground & Aims: Biofeedback therapy is effective for dyssynergic defecation (DD), but it is not widely available or reimbursed, and is labor intensive. It is therefore important to select the appropriate patients for this treatment. We investigated symptoms and demographic, manometric, and other factors associated with outcomes of biofeedback therapy in patients with DD. Methods: We performed a post hoc analysis of 2 prospective studies of biofeedback therapy in 127 adult outpatients (18–75 years old, 120 female) with chronic constipation who failed to respond to treatment with dietary fiber or laxatives (>1 year) and were diagnosed with DD based on standard criteria. In each study, patients received 1-hour, biweekly office biofeedback therapy (6 sessions) or home biofeedback therapy with a device. A therapist used visual feedback, postural, and diaphragmatic breathing techniques to teach subjects to improve defecation. Treatment success was defined by a composite of normalization of dyssynergia pattern and increase of 20 mm in baseline bowel satisfaction score. Factors were compared between the treatment success and failure groups. Intention-to-treat analysis was performed. Results: Of the 127 patients enrolled, 77 (61%) had treatment success. Dyssynergia was corrected in 78% of patients and bowel satisfaction improved in 64% of patients. Baseline demographic features, constipation symptoms, manometric and sensory parameters, balloon expulsion time, and colonic transit results were similar between treatment failure and success groups. Patients with lower baseline bowel satisfaction score (P =.008) and patients who used digital maneuvers (P =.04) were more likely to have successful biofeedback therapy. Conclusions: Biofeedback therapy is successful in more than 60% of patients with DD. Patients who used digital maneuvers and patients with lower baseline levels of bowel satisfaction were more likely to have treatment success, whereas other factors were not associated with success. Biofeedback therapy should be offered to all patients with DD, irrespective of baseline symptoms or anorectal physiology findings.']"

It comprises three indicators, namely, the Gini index, the income share held by the top 10%, and the income share held by the bottom 10%. The data from the World Bank database and the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development Income Distribution Database between 2005 and 2015 are used to demonstrate how the inequality index works. The results show that it can distinguish income inequality among countries that share the same Gini index but have different income gaps between the top 10% and the bottom 10%. It could also distinguish income inequality among countries that have the same ratio of income share held by the top 10% to income share held by the bottom 10% but differ in the values of the Gini index. In addition, the inequality index could capture the dynamics where the Gini index of a country is stable over time but the ratio of income share of the top 10% to income share of the bottom 10% is increasing. Furthermore, the inequality index could be applied to other scientific disciplines as a measure of statistical heterogeneity and for size distributions of any non-negative quantities.', 'An Alternative Functional Form for the Lorenz Curve with Empirical Applications  2023 Thailand and The World Economy. All rights reserved.Given that the Lorenz curve is widely used for analyzing income distribution and inequality, this study introduces an alternative functional form for the Lorenz curve that is constructed based on the weighted average of the exponential function and the functional form implied by Pareto distribution. Using the data on the Gini index and the decile income shares of Thailand and other 4 countries with different income inequality, socioeconomic, and regional backgrounds, this study shows that the alternative functional form meets required criteria for a good functional form suggested by Dagum (1977). Moreover, this study compares the performance of the alternative functional form to that of Kakwani (1980). The results show that the performance of the alternative functional form is comparable to that of Kakwani (1980). However, the alternative functional form has an advantage in that the Gini index can be conveniently computed since it has an explicit mathematical solution whereas, for the Kakwani (1980)’s functional form, the Gini index is computed by using the numerical integration since its closed-form expression does not exist. Furthermore, this study finds that when the values of cumulative normalized rank of income are low, the Kakwani (1980)’s functional form does not always satisfy the monotonic increasing condition for the Lorenz curve. Thus, when applying any functional form for the Lorenz curve to analyze and formulate policy at the lower tail of income distribution, the shape of the estimated Lorenz curve should be considered together with the values of goodness-of-fit statistics and the estimated Gini index.', 'A simple method for estimating the Lorenz curve  2021, The Author(s).Given many popular functional forms for the Lorenz curve do not have a closed-form expression for the Gini index and no study has utilized the observed Gini index to estimate parameter(s) associated with the corresponding parametric functional form, a simple method for estimating the Lorenz curve is introduced. It utilizes three indicators, namely, the Gini index and the income shares of the bottom and the top in order to calculate the values of parameters associated with the specified functional form which has a closed-form expression for the Gini index. No error minimization technique is required in order to estimate the Lorenz curve. The data on the Gini index and the income shares of four countries that have a different level of income inequality, economic, sociological, and regional backgrounds from the United Nations University-World Income Inequality Database are used to illustrate how the simple method works. The overall results indicate that the estimated Lorenz curves fit the actual observations practically well. This simple method could be useful in the situation where the availability of data on income distribution is low. However, if more data on income distribution are available, this study shows that the specified functional form could be used to directly estimate the Lorenz curve. Moreover, the estimated values of the Gini index calculated based on the specified functional form are virtually identical to their actual observations.']"

A comparative study China and Thailand  2017,  2017 British Association for International and Comparative Education.This research explored the relationship of principal leadership and teacher professional learning in China and Thailand. The authors tested a conceptual model in which teacher trust and agency were proposed as mediators of the effects of the principal’s learning-centered leadership on teacher professional learning. Common survey measures had been used to collect data from 1259 teachers in 38 schools in mainland China and 1071 teachers in 60 schools in Thailand. Multi-group confirmatory factor analysis, multi-group structural equation modelling, and bootstrapping were employed to compare the proposed leadership and teacher learning processes in Chinese and Thai schools. The results confirmed a similar model of strong, statistically significant, ‘mediated effects’ of principal leadership on the professional learning of teachers in the two societies. These findings contribute to our understanding of leadership effects across societies and offer insight into how policymakers and practitioners can support school leadership, teacher development, and educational change.', 'Does leadership make a difference in teacher learning: a contextual analysis of learning centered leadership in rural Thailand  2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.Research has both established that developing teacher capacity is a key to educational reform and that leadership plays a significant role in promoting teacher learning. Yet, despite education reforms that focus on teachers and teacher development, Thailand has yet to strategically utilize school leaders as the bridge between its ambitious vision and school enactment. This study examined differences between effective and ineffective school leadership practices aimed at advancing teacher learning in Thailand. Drawing upon data from a larger mixed methods study, this article employed a contrasting groups design to examine differences in the leadership and teacher learning practices in two rural secondary schools. In addition to semi-structured interviews with principals and teachers, qualitative data were also gathered from school web sites, Facebook and administrative documents. The results illustrate that, given a similar set of situational challenges, principal’s viewpoints, principles, purpose, and actions can make a difference in catalyzing, supporting, and sustaining teacher learning. The case studies show how learning centered leadership practices (or lack thereof) can shape teacher learning and contribute to a growing body of research on learning-centered leadership.', 'Leadership that matters: creating cultures of academic optimism that support teacher learning in Thailand  2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.Purpose: Research on school leadership has confirmed that principals influence teacher and student learning by building an “academic-focused ethos” in their schools. In this study, our objective was to examine if and how the learning-centered leadership of principals influenced academic optimism of teachers and the resulting effects on their engagement in professional learning. More specifically, we examined this hypothesized set of leadership effects among teachers and principals in high schools located in Thailand. Design/methodology/approach: The study was conducted with 1,763 teachers and 152 principals from 159 randomly selected, medium size secondary schools located in Thailand. The research employed multi-level structural equation modeling and bootstrapping analyses in order to test and explore these relationships in a mediation model of school leadership effects on teacher professional learning through academic optimism. Findings: Results of this study reinforce prior research which has found that principal leadership can have significant direct and indirect effects on the professional learning of teachers. This finding is important because, as elaborated earlier, scholars believe that teacher professional learning is a key to sustainable improvement in schools. More specifically, our results extend prior research in two ways. First, as the first study to link Learning-Centered Leadership with Academic Optimism, this study extends findings that point to the role of school leadership in sustaining a culture of academic optimism in schools. Second, this study also established Academic Optimism as a mediator through which school leadership supports Teacher Professional Learning. Research limitations/implications: Although our results support a positive conclusion concerning the effects of school leadership and academic optimism on teacher learning, this was a cross-sectional study. Therefore, caution must be exercised before drawing causal attributions. For example, research has also found that teachers who work in schools that evidence features of a professional learning community are more likely to have a greater sense of collective teacher efficacy, a variable that is also associated with Academic Optimism. Therefore, although our study proposed Academic Optimism as the mediator and teacher professional learning as the dependent variable, it is also possible that this relationship could be reversed or reciprocal (i.e. mutually reinforcing). Future research should continue to examine these possibilities using longitudinal and/or experimental research designs that enable clearer delineation of causal relationships. We also suggest the utility of qualitative and mixed methods studies capable of exploring in greater depth the mechanisms through which school leadership contributes to productive teacher learning. Practical implications: There is a need in Thailand, and elsewhere, to redefine the formal roles and professional standards of school leaders to include learning-centered practices. These standards should be embedded into the redesign of pre-service and in-service education programs for teachers and principals. We believe that, at present, relatively few school leaders in Thailand genuinely understand the meaningful impact they can have on teacher learning, and by extension, on student learning. Thus, there is a need for systemic change that recasts the nature of leadership expected from principals as well as the level of lifelong learning expected of teachers. Originality/value: The findings from this research contribute to an evolving knowledge base on how school leaders influence teacher learning in different national contexts. The research also extends prior research by exploring the role of academic optimism as a mediator of school leadership effects on teacher learning.']"

Because the proposed method uses infrared light for illumination, the method can be used to detect a pulse wave on a human face without visible lighting. The corresponding two-band pixel values in the video signals can be separated into hemoglobin and shading components by application of a separation matrix in logarithmic space for the two pixel values. Because the shading component has been separated, the extracted hemoglobin component is then robust to fluctuations in the illumination. The pixel values in the region of interest were spatially averaged over all the pixels of each frame. These averaged values were then used to form the raw trace signal. Finally, the pulse wave and the corresponding pulse rate were obtained from the raw trace signal through several signal processing stages, including detrending, use of an adaptive bandpass filter, and peak detection. We evaluated the absolute error rate for the pulse rate between the estimated value and the ground truth obtained using an electrocardiogram.

This research aims to elucidate the hydrogen effects in different Lewis acid-doped ZN catalysts on ethylene polymerization behaviors in terms of catalytic activity and polymer properties. With the absence of hydrogen during polymerization, it was found that ZnCl2 decreased the catalytic, because it acted as a catalyst poison. The catalytic activity was in the order of None–THF &gt; ZnFe–THF &gt; ZnAl–THF &gt; Zn–THF. Thus, the addition of second Lewis acids such as AlCl3 and FeCl2 was able to improve the catalytic activity of Zn–THF catalyst. In addition, ZnFe–THF catalyst exhibited slightly higher activity than ZnAl–THF catalyst. This is because FeCl2 may better participate in MgCl2 structure due to similar atomic radius, leading to more efficiently removal of the remaining THF in the final catalyst. With the presence of hydrogen during polymerization, the decrease in catalytic activity was in the order of ZnFe–THF &lt; ZnAl–THF &lt; Zn–THF &lt; None–THF with increasing H2/C2H4 molar ratio from 0.08 to 0.60.

All rights reserved.This study aims to investigate the influences of a combination of cocatalysts including triethylalumi-num (TEA) and tri-n-octylaluminum (TnOA) for activation of a commercial Ti-based Ziegler-Natta cat-alyst during ethylene polymerization and ethylene/1-hexene copolymerization on the change in Ti3+ during polymerization. Thus, electron spin resonance (ESR) technique was performed to monitor the change in Ti3+ depending on the catalyst activation by a single and combination of cocatalyst. It re-vealed that the amount of Ti3+ played a crucial role on both ethylene polymerization and ethylene/1-hexene copolymerization. For ethylene polymerization, the activation with TEA apparently resulted in the highest catalytic activity. The activation with TEA+TnOA combination exhibited a moderate activi-ty, whereas TnOA activation gave the lowest activity. In case of ethylene/1-hexene copolymerization, it revealed that the presence of 1-hexene decreased activity. The effect of different cocatalysts tended to be similar to the one in the absence of 1-hexene. The decrease of temperature from 80 to 70 °C in eth-ylene/1-hexene copolymerization tended to lower catalytic activity for TnOA and TEA+TnOA, whereas only slight effect was observed for TEA system. The effect of different cocatalyst activation on the change of Ti3+ state of catalyst was elucidated by ESR measurement. It appeared that the activation of catalyst with TEA+TnOA combination essentially inhibited the reduction of Ti3+ to Ti2+ leading to lower activity. Furthermore, the polymer properties such as morphology and crystallinity can be altered by different cocatalysts.', 'Impact of AlCl3 and FeCl2 Addition on Catalytic Behaviors of TiCl4/MgCl2/THF Catalysts for Ethylene Polymerization and Ethylene/1-Hexene Copolymerization Copyright  2018 BCREC Group. All rights reserved.The present research focuses on elucidating of the impact of Lewis acids including AlCl3 and FeCl2 addition on catalytic behaviors during ethylene polymerization and ethylene/1-hexene copolymerization over the TiCl4/MgCl2/THF catalyst (Cat. A). In this study, the Cat. A with the absence and presence of Lewis acids was synthesized via the chemical route. Then, all catalyst samples were characterized and tested in the slurry polymerization. For ethylene polymerization, using the Cat. A with the presence of AlCl3 apparently gave the highest activity among other catalysts. In addition, the activity of catalysts tended to increase with the presence of the Lewis acids. This can be attributed to an enhancement of active center distribution by the addition of Lewis acids leading to larger amounts of the isolated Ti species. Moreover, with the presence of Lewis acids, the effect of hydrogen on the decreased activity was also less pronounced. Considering ethylene/1-hexene copolymerization, it revealed that the catalyst with the presence of mixed Lewis acids (AlCl3 + FeCl2) exhibited the highest activity. It is suggested that the presence of mixed Lewis acids possibly caused a change in acidity of active sites, which is suitable for copolymerization. However, activities of all catalysts in ethylene/1-hexene copolymerization were lower than those in ethylene polymerization. The effect of hydrogen on the decreased activity for both polymerization and copolymerization system was found to be similar with the presence of Lewis acids. Based on this study, it is quite promising to enhance the catalytic activity by addition of proper Lewis acids, especially when the pressure of hydrogen increases. The characteristics of polymers obtained upon the presence of Lewis acids will be discussed further in more detail.']"

Untreated and treated clay specimens were tested for their mechanical properties and microstructures through unconfined compression (UC) tests, free–free resonance (FFR) tests, X-ray diffraction (XRD) tests, and scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive X-ray (SEM/EDX) tests. Results showed that both vegetative cells and bacterial spores can effectively enhance the strength and modulus of clays by inducing MICP to generate calcite crystals. Clays treated with vegetative cells exhibited earlier improvements in their strength than clays treated with bacterial spores due to earlier activity availability; however, the clays treated with bacterial spores exhibited greater strength improvements in the long term. Bacterial spores may also prove more convenient to use in geotechnical engineering practice.', ""Efficiency of microbially-induced calcite precipitation in natural clays for ground improvement  2021 Elsevier LtdMicrobially-induced calcite precipitation (MICP) is a promising technique to improve the engineering properties of soft soil in a sustainable, environmentally friendly, and energy saving manner. This study determined the suitable chemical condition to induce MICP activity from alkaliphilic urease-producing Sporosarcina pasteurii bacterium, and to explore the MICP activity's effectiveness in improving the mechanical properties of three types of natural fine-grained soils (Kaolin clay, Laterite, and Bangkok clay). Untreated and treated clays were evaluated by the free-free resonant frequency test, unconfined compression test, and their microstructures and chemical compositions. The results showed that a urea-Ca2+ input rate of 7.5 mmol/h efficiently promoted the precipitation of calcite by bacteria, as indicated by the highest degree of media clogging in sand column tests. A higher urea-Ca2+ input rate created soil samples that exhibited a high degree of supersaturation, which impacted the precipitation pattern at the microscale, resulting in less contact between soil particles; this was caused by the increase in salinity of the solution to a level that inhibited bacterial activity and retarded calcite precipitation. Once the optimal urea-Ca2+ input rate was determined, bacterial cultures were introduced into samples of each clay, and fed with the optimal chemical mixture while being maintained at room temperature (25–30 °C) for 7 d. Increases in the samples’ stiffness and shear strength coincided with increased amounts of precipitated calcite. Enhancements to each clay type's strength parameters were dependent on the natural characteristics of clay. Specifically, liquid media carrying the necessary nutrients for MICP activity could not efficiently permeate through the clayey soil with a high plasticity, resulting in a lower observable degree of MICP activity to improve the soil's characteristics."", ""Self-repairing of shrinkage crack in mortar containing microencapsulated bacterial spores  2023 The Author(s)The purpose of this research work was to evaluate the efficacy of microbially induced calcite precipitation (MICP) method in shrinkage crack repairing.

The microencapsulated bacterial spores were employed as an additive substance at ratios of 0%, 0.5%, and 1% by weight of cement. Specimens were kept in a climate-controlled room after casting to induce shrinkage crack. Crystalline phases formed in the specimen were identified using the X-ray diffraction (XRD) technique. The scanning electron microscopy/energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry (SEM/EDS) method was used to investigate the morphology of precipitated calcite (CaCO3) crystals. Additionally, the specimen's permeability and compressive strength were also determined. When the bacterial spores were added to produce MICP procedure, the results demonstrated that it was successful in healing the shrinkage cracking. Within three days, the specimen with 1% spores could completely seal the shrinkage crack. According to the XRD patterns, the CaCO3 crystals appeared to promote the production of the calcite phase. Based on SEM/EDS investigation, the MICP process leads to concentrations of calcite crystal in certain regions, especially at the top surface of the crack. The 28-day compressive strength, on the other hand, decreased, owing to the addition of nutrients.""]"

In addition, the developed approach was used for the quantification of chromium species in water samples.', 'Determination of Cr(III) and Cr(VI) in water by dual-gel electromembrane extraction and a microfluidic paper-based device  2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.A major goal of green chemistry is to avoid the use of toxic organic solvents. In particular, there are few green methods allowing extraction and quantification of chromium species in environmental samples. Here, we developed home-made, dual-gel electromembrane extraction combined with a microfluidic paper-based analytical device for the simultaneous determination of Cr(III) and Cr(VI) in water, without using any organic solvent. The positively charged Cr(III) and negatively charged Cr(VI) migrated selectively into the cathodic (pH 2.0) and anodic (pH 3.0) aqueous acceptor phases, respectively. After extraction, the anodic acceptor phase containing Cr(VI) was analyzed directly by a microfluidic paper-based analytical device, after the addition of the diphenylcarbazide colorimetric reagent. The cathodic acceptor phase containing Cr(III) was mixed with Ce(IV) to oxidize Cr(III) to Cr(VI), and then, Cr(VI) ions were detected on the microfluidic paper-based analytical device after adding diphenylcarbazide. Under the optimized conditions, limits of detection of 2.0 and 3.0 ng/mL and extraction recoveries of 58.8% and 83.3% were achieved for Cr(VI) and Cr(III), respectively.', 'Chromium speciation using paper-based analytical devices by direct determination and with electromembrane microextraction  2019 Elsevier B.V.In this study, we developed and compared three different methods for chromium speciation in water samples using microfluidic paper-based analytical devices (μPADs). In all methods, detection was based on the complexation reaction of Cr(VI) with diphenylcarbazide on the μPADs. Cr(III) ions were oxidized to Cr(VI) by Ce(IV) prior to colorimetric detection on the μPADs. In the first method, oxidization of Cr(III) to Cr(VI) in the solution containing both trivalent and hexavalent chromium was performed using a batch procedure to obtain total chromium. A dual electromembrane extraction (DEME) technique for simultaneous preconcentration and extraction of chromium species and a single electromembrane extraction (SEME) for preconcentration and extraction of Cr(VI)/total chromium [quantified as Cr(VI) content after oxidation of Cr(III) ions to Cr(VI)] were used in the second and third methods, respectively. The electromembrane extraction was based on the electrokinetic migration of cationic Cr(III) and anionic Cr(VI) toward the cathode and anode, respectively, into the two different hollow fibres. Octanol-1 and bis(2-ethylhexyl) phosphate (DEHP) in octanol-1 (0.7% v/v) were the most suitable supported liquid membranes for extraction of Cr(VI) and Cr(III), respectively. Among these methods, SEME showed the lowest limits of detection for both analytes. Under optimized conditions, linear calibrations were obtained for Cr(III) from 3 to 30 μg L−1 and for Cr(VI) from 3 to 70 μg L−1. The detection limits were 1.0 μg L−1 and 0.7 μg L−1 for Cr(III) and Cr(VI), respectively. Our developed method was applied to analyse water samples spiked with different concentrations of Cr(III) and Cr(VI) at the parts-per-billion (ppb) level. The statistical evaluation showed that the proposed method agreed well with the validation method, i.e., inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES).']"

This study investigates the effects of the key parameters on SOFC system efficiency and temperature gradient within a SOFC stack. A 40-cell SOFC stack integrated with a bio-oil sorption-enhanced steam reformer is simulated using MATLAB and DETCHEM. When the air-to-fuel ratio and steam-to-fuel ratio increase, the stack average temperature and temperature gradient decrease. However, a decrease in the stack temperature steadily reduces the system efficiency owing to the tradeoff between the stack performance and thermal balance between heat recovered and consumed by the system. With an increase in the bio-oil flow rate, the system efficiency decreases because of the lower resident time for the electrochemical reaction. This is not, however, beneficial to the maximum temperature gradient. To minimize the temperature gradient of the SOFC stack, a decrease in the bio-oil flow rate is the most effective way. The maximum temperature gradient can be reduced to 14.6 K cm−1 with the stack and system efficiency of 76.58 and 65.18%, respectively, when the SOFC system is operated at an air-to-fuel ratio of 8, steam-to-fuel ratio of 6, and bio-oil flow rate of 0.0041 mol s−1.', 'Hydrogen and power generation via integrated bio-oil sorption-enhanced steam reforming and solid oxide fuel cell systems: Economic feasibility analysis  2020 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLCA solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) is a promising technology for generating electricity and heat with high efficiency and environmental friendliness. The use of a bio-oil as a renewable and low-cost feedstock for an external reforming SOFC system can reduce fossil fuel consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. From a technical perspective, high-purity hydrogen (H2) for SOFCs can be produced from the sorption-enhanced steam reforming (SESR). In this study, an economic analysis of a bio-oil SESR and SOFC integrated system (160 kW alternating current electricity production) is performed to evaluate the feasibility of the designed process. An economic comparison of the systems with different configurations, i.e., SESR-SOFC integrated systems with and without anode gas recirculation and a conventional reforming-based SOFC system (CON-SOFC), is presented in terms of their net present cost (NPC) and levelized cost of energy (LCOE). According to the results, the SESR-SOFC system with anode gas recirculation is more favorable than the CON-SOFC system and SESR-SOFC system without recirculation. Nevertheless, it remains economically infeasible because its NPC in the 20th year is approximately 6.13% higher than that of the combined heat and power (CHP) system (a base case). However, it can attain economic equivalence with the CHP system when a carbon tax of at least $15 tCO2−1 is considered or when the SOFC capital cost, interest rate, and bio-oil cost are separately reduced by 14%, 21%, and 37%, respectively. In addition, an increase in feed-in tariff has the highest impact on the NPC reduction of the renewable bio-oil SESR-SOFC integrated system with recirculation.', 'Performance assessment of a 10 kW pressurized solid oxide fuel cell integrated with glycerol supercritical water reforming  2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.In this work, the integrated system of pressurized solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) and supercritical water reforming of glycerol was proposed. The syngas from the reforming process has high temperature and pressure and thus, it can be used as fuel for the SOFC. The performance of an integrated system was determined through the Aspen Plus simulator in which the electrochemical equations were also included. The developed model was employed to examine the performance of the integrated system with respect to the wider ranges of operation of the reformer and SOFC. In this work, the desired power output of an SOFC stack is set as 10 kW and thus, the area of an SOFC is determined. A smaller area is required as it normally leads to a lower fabrication cost for the SOFC. The simulation results revealed that the smallest SOFC area can be provided when the reformer is operated at 800°C and 240 atm with a ratio of supercritical water to glycerol as 50 whereas the SOFC operation is at 900°C and 4 atm with the current density as 7000 A/m2. Under these operating conditions, the integrated system can provide the cell voltage, required area, fuel utilization, and SOFC efficiency as 1 V, 1.42 m2, 75% and 61%, respectively. From the exergy analysis, it was found that the compressor, heater, and turbine are the highest exergy destruction units whereas the reformer has the lowest exergy destruction, followed by the SOFC stack.']"

By applying data integration, raw BEMS data can be employed for multiple purposes. For example, power consumption data can be matched with motion sensor data and electric appliance details in any staff room to calculate wasted energy and continually predict an individual electric appliance status. Therefore, disclosing these data severely violates local electricity users' privacy. To resolve data privacy concerns using differential privacy, the traditional Laplacian mechanism cannot be used to detect overloads and the standard coin-flipping algorithm gives a high percentage error of wasted energy calculation. Thus, this paper proposes a modified truncated Laplacian noise addition and random motion state processes to hide the actual electrical use and movement patterns. Based on a 30-day sample period of actual BEMS, both privacy and usability of the proposed processes have been compared with the traditional methods in terms of the privacy loss parameter, the reported error of energy consumption, the correctness of overload detection, and the error of the wasted energy calculation.

Building climate control is of strong research interest due to high energy savings potentials associated with heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) controls. Because the operation of HVAC systems directly influences occupant thermal comfort, building-specific thermal models are needed for proper control. Such models describe how indoor temperature changes under different environmental conditions and HVAC status. Previous studies mainly developed thermal models for accurate building thermal simulation which are not practical for use in real-world applications as they require domain knowledge and lengthy building-by-building configuration. In this article, taking advantage of IoT technologies, a plug-and-play learning framework is proposed to automatically identify the thermal model of each thermal zone in a building without manual configuration. In contrast to the existing methods, a thermal model is learned using low-resolution temperature readings from IoT-based smart thermostats. The learning framework has been validated using the data collected from an IoT platform installed in a building over a summer. The performance of the learned model and the error of indoor temperature prediction based on this model have been evaluated and quantified. Findings demonstrate the learning process can be automated with either edge-computing or cloud-computing. This article shows the validity of the proposed IoT-based thermal model learning framework and offers a pragmatic solution for providing reliable thermal models to future smart building climate controls.']"

Here, we present a new multi-proxy (δ18O and δ13C values, trace element concentrations, and grayscale values) data set of stalagmite KPC1 from Khao Prae cave in western Thailand spanning the last 1400 years (500–1900 CE; the Common Era). These multi-proxy data reveal a high variability between the wet and dry periods during 500–850 CE and 1150–1300 CE, stable climate conditions during 850–1150 CE, and overall dry conditions since 1300 CE. The δ13C values, trace elements concentrations, and grayscale values show centennial-scale fluctuations, which were probably driven by local hydrological processes. In contrast, variations in the stalagmite δ18O values reflect integrated changes in rainfall amount from the ISM. The KPC1 record agrees with other speleothem δ18O records of Southeast Asian summer monsoon from the last millennium, as well as the lake multi-proxy and tree-ring PDSI data from Mainland Southeast Asia, but diverges from records from the Indo-Pacific equatorial regions and the western Pacific. We conclude that hydroclimate variability at the western side of Mainland Southeast Asia is mainly driven by changes in moisture transport of the ISM. On socially relevant timescales, the KPC1 data set shows that a period of stable rainfall (850–1150 CE) coincides with the early success of the early empires (e.g., Pagan, Angkor, and Dai Viet) in Mainland Southeast Asia. In line with previous studies in the region, we speculate that the high variability in rainfall between 1150 and 1300 CE and droughts during 1300–1550 CE played a significant role in the demise of ancient societies in Southeast Asia.', 'The SISAL database: A global resource to document oxygen and carbon isotope records from speleothems  Author(s) 2018.Stable isotope records from speleothems provide information on past climate changes, most particularly information that can be used to reconstruct past changes in precipitation and atmospheric circulation.

A number of modelling groups will be running isotope-enabled palaeoclimate simulations in the framework of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6, so it is timely to evaluate different approaches to using the speleothem data for data-model comparisons. Here, we illustrate this using 456 globally distributed speleothem d18O records from an updated version of the Speleothem Isotopes Synthesis and Analysis (SISAL) database and palaeoclimate simulations generated using the ECHAM5-wiso isotope-enabled atmospheric circulation model. We show that the SISAL records reproduce the first-order spatial patterns of isotopic variability in the modern day, strongly supporting the application of this dataset for evaluating model-derived isotope variability into the past. However, the discontinuous nature of many speleothem records complicates the process of procuring large numbers of records if data-model comparisons are made using the traditional approach of comparing anomalies between a control period and a given palaeoclimate experiment. To circumvent this issue, we illustrate techniques through which the absolute isotope values during any time period could be used for model evaluation. Specifically, we show that speleothem isotope records allow an assessment of a model's ability to simulate spatial isotopic trends. Our analyses provide a protocol for using speleothem isotope data for model evaluation, including screening the observations to take into account the impact of speleothem mineralogy on d18O values, the optimum period for the modern observational baseline and the selection of an appropriate time window for creating means of the isotope data for palaeo-time-slices.""]"

However, the sustainable development of this sector is hampered by disease epidemics, especially those caused by bacteria such as Aeromonas species. At least eight pathogenic motile Aeromonas species (A. hydrophila, A. veronii, A. jandaei, A. caviae, A. sobria, A. bestiarum, A. dhakensis and A. schubertii) have been reported in aquaculture with some causing up to 100% mortality during disease outbreaks.

Tilapia is a primary aquaculture fish in Thailand, but little is known about the occurrence of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in Aeromonas hydrophila, Salmonella spp., and Vibrio cholerae colonizing healthy tilapia intended for human consumption and the co-occurrence of these AMR bacteria in the cultivation water. Methods. This study determined the phenotype and genotype of AMR, extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL) production, and virulence factors of A. hydrophila, Salmonella spp., and V. cholerae isolated from hybrid red tilapia and cultivation water in Thailand. Standard culture methods such as USFDA’s BAM or ISO procedures were used for the original isolation, with all isolates confirmed by biochemical tests, serotyping, and species-specific gene detection based on PCR. Results. A total of 278 isolates consisting of 15 A. hydrophila, 188 Salmonella spp., and 75 V. cholerae isolates were retrieved from a previous study. All isolates of A. hydrophila and Salmonella isolates were resistance to at least one antimicrobial, with 26.7% and 72.3% of the isolates being multidrug resistant (MDR), respectively. All A. hydrophila isolates were resistant to ampicillin (100%), followed by oxytetracycline (26.7%), tetracycline (26.7%), trimethoprim (26.7%), and oxolinic acid (20.0%). The predominant resistance genes in A. hydrophila were mcr-3 (20.0%), followed by 13.3% of isolates having floR, qnrS, sul1, sul2, and dfrA1. Salmonella isolates also exhibited a high prevalence of resistance to ampicillin (79.3%), oxolinic acid (75.5%), oxytetracycline (71.8%), chloramphenicol (62.8%), and florfenicol (55.3%). The most common resistance genes in these Salmonella isolates were qnrS (65.4%), tetA (64.9%), blaTEM (63.8%), and floR (55.9%). All V. cholerae isolates were susceptible to all antimicrobials tested, while the most common resistance gene was sul1 (12.0%). One isolate of A. hydrophila was positive for int1, while all isolates of Salmonella and V. cholerae isolates were negative for integrons and intSXT. None of the bacterial isolates in this study were producing ESBL. The occurrence of mcr-3 (20.0%) in these isolates from tilapia aquaculture may signify a serious occupational and consumer health risk given that colistin is a last resort antimicrobial for treatment of Gram-negative bacteria infections. Conclusions. Findings from this study on AMR bacteria in hybrid red tilapia suggest that aquaculture as practiced in Thailand can select for ubiquitous AMR pathogens, mobile genetic elements, and an emerging reservoir of mcr and colistin-resistant bacteria. Resistant and pathogenic bacteria, such as resistance to ampicillin and tetracycline, or MDR Salmonella circulating in aquaculture, together highlight the public health concerns and foodborne risks of zoonotic pathogens in humans from cultured freshwater fish.', 'Diversity and antimicrobial susceptibility profiles of Aeromonas spp. isolated from diseased freshwater fishes in Thailand  2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.Motile Aeromonas septicemia (MAS), a disease caused by Aeromonas spp., is recognized as a major disease in freshwater aquaculture.

All isolates were identified using biochemical characteristics, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS), polymerase chain reaction assays, and the gyrB gene sequence analysis. The result of MALDI-TOF MS showed 100% (86 isolates) accuracy at genus-level identification, and 88.4% (76 isolates) accuracy at species-level identification.

The multiple antibiotic resistance (MAR) index varied between 0.14 and 0.86, with MAR values more than 0.2 in 99% of isolates. Furthermore, four diverse multidrug-resistant (MDR) patterns were found among Aeromonas isolates.

During 3 years at Khao Chong (KHC) in southern Thailand we reared 17,555 insects from 343.2 kg or 39,252 seeds/fruits representing 357 liana and tree species. A commented list of the 243 insect species identified is provided, with details about their host plants. We observed the following. (i) Approximately 43% of identified species can be considered pests. Most were seed eaters, particularly on dry fruits. (ii) Approximately 19% of parasitoid species (all Opiinae) for which we could determine whether their primary insect host was a pest or not (all Bactrocera spp. breeding in fruits) can be considered beneficials. (iii) The seeds/fruits of approximately 28% of the plant species in this forest were free of attack. Phyllanthaceae, Rubiaceae and Meliaceae were attacked relatively infrequently; in contrast, Annonaceae, Fabaceae, Sapindaceae and Myristicaceae were more heavily attacked. There was no apparent effect of plant phylogeny on rates of attack but heavily attacked tree species had larger basal area in the KHC plot than rarely attacked tree species. (iv) Insects reared from fleshy fruits were more likely to show relatively stable populations compared to insects reared from dry fruits, but this was not true of insects reared from dipterocarps, which appeared to have relatively stable populations throughout the study period. We tentatively conclude that insects feeding on seeds and fruits have little effect on observed levels of host abundance in this forest.', 'A cross-continental comparison of assemblages of seed- and fruit-feeding insects in tropical rain forests: Faunal composition and rates of attack  2018 John Wiley & Sons LtdAim: Insects feeding on seeds and fruits represent interesting study systems, potentially able to lower the fitness of their host plants. In addition to true seed eaters, a suite of insects feed on the fleshy parts of fruits. We examined the likelihood of community convergence in whole insect assemblages attacking seeds/fruits in three tropical rain forests. Location: Three ForestGEO permanent forest plots within different biogeographical regions: Barro Colorado Island (Panama), Khao Chong (Thailand) and Wanang (Papua New Guinea). Methods: We surveyed 1,186 plant species and reared 1.1 ton of seeds/fruits that yielded 80,600 insects representing at least 1,678 species. We assigned seeds/fruits to predation syndromes on the basis of plant traits relevant to insects, seed/fruit appearance and mesocarp thickness. Results: We observed large differences in insect faunal composition, species richness and guild structure between our three study sites. We hypothesize that the high species richness of insect feeding on seeds/fruits in Panama may result from a conjunction of low plant species richness and high availability of dry fruits. Insect assemblages were weakly influenced by seed predation syndromes, both at the local and regional scale, and the effect of host phylogeny varied also among sites. At the driest site (Panama), the probability of seeds of a plant species being attacked depended more on seed availability than on the measured seed traits of that plant species. However, when seeds were attacked, plant traits shaping insect assemblages were difficult to identify and not related to seed availability. Main conclusions: We observed only weak evidence of community convergence at the intercontinental scale among these assemblages. Our study suggests that seed eaters may be most commonly associated with dry fruits at relatively dry tropical sites where fleshy fruits may be less prevalent.', ""Host specificity and interaction networks of insects feeding on seeds and fruits in tropical rainforests  2021 Nordic Society Oikos. Published by John Wiley & Sons LtdIn the tropics, antagonistic seed predation networks may have different properties than mutualistic pollination and seed dispersal networks, but the former have been considerably less studied. We tested whether the structure of antagonistic tripartite networks composed of host plants, insects developing within seeds and fruits, and their insect parasitoids could be predicted from plant phylogenetic distance and plant traits. We considered subsets of the networks (‘subnetworks') at three rainforest locations (Panama, Thailand, Papua New Guinea), based on insect families, plant families or plant functional groups. We recorded 3197 interactions and observed a low percentage of realized interactions, especially in Panama, where insect host specificity was higher than in Thailand or New Guinea. Several factors may explain this, including insect faunal composition, incidence of dry fruits, high fruit production and high occurrence of Fabaceae at the Panamanian site. Host specificity was greater among seed-eaters than pulp-eaters and for insects feeding on dry fruits as opposed to insects feeding on fleshy fruits. Plant species richness within plant families did not influence insect host specificity, but site characteristics may be important in this regard. Most subnetworks were extremely specialized, such as those including Tortricidae and Bruchinae in Panama. Plant phylogenetic distance, plant basal area and plant traits (fruit length, number of seeds per fruit) had important effects on several network statistics in regressions weighted by sampling effort. A path analysis revealed a weak direct influence of plant phylogenetic distance on parasitoid richness, indicating limited support for the ‘nasty host hypothesis'. Our study emphasizes the duality between seed dispersal and seed predation networks in the tropics, as key plant species differ and host specificity tends to be low in the former and higher in the latter.

Although a flavin C4a-peroxide anion is postulated to be the intermediate reacting with aldehyde prior to light liberation, no clear identification of the protonation status of this intermediate has been reported. Here, transient kinetics, pH variation, and site-directed mutagenesis were employed to probe the protonation state of the flavin C4a-hydroperoxide in bacterial luciferase. The first observed intermediate, with a λmax of 385 nm, transformed to an intermediate with a λmax of 375 nm. Spectra of the first observed intermediate were pH-dependent, with a λmax of 385 nm at pH < 8.5 and 375 at pH > 9, correlating with a pKa of 7.7–8.1. These data are consistent with the first observed flavin C4a intermediate at pH < 8.5 being the protonated flavin C4a-hydroperoxide, which loses a proton to become an active flavin C4a-peroxide. Stopped-flow studies of His44Ala, His44Asp, and His44Asn variants showed only a single intermediate with a λmax of 385 nm at all pH values, and none of these variants generate light. These data indicate that His44 variants only form a flavin C4a-hydroperoxide, but not an active flavin C4a-peroxide, indicating an essential role for His44 in deprotonating the flavin C4a-hydroperoxide and initiating chemical catalysis. We also investigated the function of the adjacent His45; stopped-flow data and molecular dynamics simulations identify the role of this residue in binding reduced FMN.', 'Rapid kinetics reveal surprising flavin chemistry in bifurcating electron transfer flavoprotein from Acidaminococcus fermentans  2020 THE AUTHORS.Electron bifurcation uses free energy from exergonic redox reactions to power endergonic reactions. β-FAD of the electron transfer flavoprotein (EtfAB) from the anaerobic bacterium Acidaminococcus fermentans bifurcates the electrons of NADH, sending one to the low-potential ferredoxin and the other to the high-potential α-FAD semiquinone (α-FAD−). The resultant α-FAD hydroquinone (α-FADH−) transfers one electron further to butyryl-CoA dehydrogenase (Bcd); two such transfers enable Bcd to reduce crotonyl-CoA to butyryl-CoA. To get insight into the mechanism of these intricate reactions, we constructed an artificial reaction only with EtfAB containing α-FAD or α-FAD− to monitor formation of α-FAD− or α-FADH−, respectively, using stopped flow kinetic measurements. In the presence of α-FAD, we observed that NADH transferred a hydride to β-FAD at a rate of 920 s−1, yielding the charge–transfer complex NAD+:β-FADH− with an absorbance maximum at 650 nm. β-FADH− bifurcated one electron to α-FAD and the other electron to α-FAD of a second EtfAB molecule, forming two stable α-FAD−. With α-FAD−, the reduction of β-FAD with NADH was 1500 times slower. Reduction of β-FAD in the presence of α-FAD displayed a normal kinetic isotope effect (KIE) of 2.1, whereas the KIE was inverted in the presence of α-FAD−. These data indicate that a nearby radical (14 Å apart) slows the rate of a hydride transfer and inverts the KIE. This unanticipated flavin chemistry is not restricted to Etf–Bcd but certainly occurs in other bifurcating Etfs found in anaerobic bacteria and archaea.', 'Modulations of the reduction potentials of flavin-based electron bifurcation complexes and semiquinone stabilities are key to control directional electron flow  2020 Federation of European Biochemical SocietiesThe flavin-based electron bifurcation (FBEB) system from Acidaminococcus fermentans is composed of the electron transfer flavoprotein (EtfAB) and butyryl-CoA dehydrogenase (Bcd). α-FAD binds to domain II of the A-subunit of EtfAB, β-FAD to the B-subunit of EtfAB and δ-FAD to Bcd. NADH reduces β-FAD to β-FADH−, which bifurcates one electron to the high potential α-FAD•− semiquinone followed by the other to the low potential ferredoxin (Fd). As deduced from crystal structures, upon interaction of EtfAB with Bcd, the formed α-FADH− approaches δ-FAD by rotation of domain II, yielding δ-FAD•−. Repetition of this process leads to a second reduced ferredoxin (Fd−) and δ-FADH−, which reduces crotonyl-CoA to butyryl-CoA. In this study, we measured the redox properties of the components EtfAB, EtfaB (Etf without α-FAD), Bcd, and Fd, as well as of the complexes EtfaB:Bcd, EtfAB:Bcd, EtfaB:Fd, and EftAB:Fd. In agreement with the structural studies, we have shown for the first time that the interaction of EtfAB with Bcd drastically decreases the midpoint reduction potential of α-FAD to be within the same range of that of β-FAD and to destabilize the semiquinone of α-FAD. This finding clearly explains that these interactions facilitate the passing of electrons from β-FADH− via α-FAD•− to the final electron acceptor δ-FAD•− on Bcd. The interactions modulate the semiquinone stability of δ-FAD in an opposite way by having a greater semiquinone stability than in free Bcd.']"

This study's argument is constructed based on an aggregate of written fragments about the Kling in both Portuguese primary sources and the wider academic literature. We reveal that, amongst the many ways in which Siam benefited from the Iberian invasion of Melaka in 1511, the dramatic geopolitical rupture of the invasion re-routed trade across the Bay of Bengal. As a result, Kling merchants began arriving in Ayutthaya in greater numbers via the new network of Siamese-controlled ports and portages. Moreover, this study demonstrates the utility of greater synergy among South Asian, Southeast Asian, Thai, and Malay Studies through focusing on the exonyms employed in primary and secondary sources. Finally, this article contends that Ayutthaya's ethnic and religious cosmopolitanism was impacted by the arrival of South Asian Muslims, referred to as Kling in the Malay World and Khaek in Siam, approximately one century before Persians arrived in greater numbers.

The likelihood of having a second wheezing episode following the first attack remains unclearly established. OBJECTIVES: This study aims to investigate the incidence of recurrent wheezing in preschool children presenting with first wheezing episode and identify the associated factors. METHODS: The study is an observational prospective study conducted at the inpatient pediatric department. Patients admitted with first episode of wheezing were followed up as an outpatient approximately one week after hospital discharge and subsequently followed up by telephone 3-monthly with a structured questionnaire seeking information concerning recurrent wheezing, defined as having a second wheezing episode requiring bronchodilator within a 1-year period. RESULTS: The total of 97 patients, aged 6 months to 5 years, were recruited from June 2014 to November 2015. Thirty-five patients were excluded because of inaccessibility for telephone follow-up. Amongst the remaining 62 patients, twenty-eight (45.2%) had recurrent wheezing within one year. The mean lapse duration was 4.7 ± 3.7 months after the first episode. Having an allergic sensitization to aeroallergen was a risk factor for recurrent wheezing (OR 2.48, 95%CI 1.81-3.4). Although not statistically significant, having an allergic sensitization to food seems to be another related factor (OR 2.36, 95%CI 1.75-3.18). CONCLUSION: The recurrent rate of wheezing was 45%, which was considerably significant. Allergic sensitization to aeroallergen might increase the risk.

Objective: The objectives of this project are to study the prevalence and severity of the most common allergic diseases. i.e. asthma, rhinoconjunctivitis and eczema among children living in Bangkok. Methods: A cross-sectional multi-centers survey using GAN Core questionnaires on asthma, rhinoconjunctivitis and eczema symptoms were completed by parents of children aged 6-7 years and children aged 13–14 years. Results: The total of 6,291 questionnaires were eligible for the analysis. The cumulative vs. 12-month period prevalence of the three conditions for all children were: 24.4% vs. 13.5% for wheezing, 51.1% vs. 43.6% for rhinitis and 15.8% vs. 14.2% for eczema, respectively. The period prevalence of wheezing for younger children (14.6%) was higher than for older children (12.5%). Prevalences of severe wheeze and exercise wheeze were more common among older children (2.9% and 14.8%). The 12-month prevalences of rhinitis (43.6%) and rhinoconjunctivitis (16.3%) were higher in both age groups. Eczema, as the same to the other conditions, occurred more frequently in both groups (period prevalence of 14.3% and 14.0%) comparing to ISAAC phase III.

Factors associated with recurrent wheezing were explored. Methods: A longitudinal study was conducted among 236 children, aged between 6 months and 5 years, who were hospitalized with acute wheezing in 4 hospitals located in Bangkok and adjacent provinces, Thailand. Demographics, house environments and clinical characteristic data were collected at entry. Serum specific IgE levels against common food and inhalant allergens and serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) concentrations were measured. Results: At entry, the mean age was 24.4 months (SD = 15.7 months). Of 236 hospitalized children with acute wheezing, ninety-four cases (39.8%) were the first wheezing episode of life. By laboratory results, 197 (83.5%) and 56 (23.7%) children were atopic and had vitamin D insufficiency respectively. There were 195 cases completely followed for 12 months.

This study examined the starch compositional, structural, and functional variability among five Thai glutinous rice cultivars, and the effect of molecular structure and composition on starch functionality was pinpointed. Findings: Amylose content, amylopectin chain-length distribution (CLD), and relative crystallinity were not different among the cultivars (p ≤.05), whereas RD14 possessed largest mean granule diameter. Conclusion temperature of gelatinization and peak viscosity (PV) were lowest in RD6 and RD10, respectively, while RD6, RD10, and RD14 had lower breakdown (BD) compared to others. Despite small variation within each parameter, multivariate analysis revealed the distinct characteristic of waxy donor, RD6, and RD10 compared to others.

Gel containing 15% w/w of starch was prepared from rice starch, tapioca starch or blended rice starch/tapioca starch (1:0.85 w/w) mixed with water, 45oBx sucrose solution or coconut milk. The result showed that rice starch gel stored at 4 °C had highest hardness, degree of syneresis and melting enthalpy of the retrograded structure (ΔHret). Degree of syneresis of frozen rice starch gels subjected to several freezing-thawing cycles was also highest. Under chilled temperature storage, starch gels containing sucrose or coconut milk had higher hardness and denser gel structure, comparing to the starch gels in water. This textural change was due to greater degree of starch retrogradation, sucrose recrystallization and/or formation of amylose-lipid complex crystallites shown in X-ray diffractograms. However, addition of highly concentrated sucrose or coconut milk increased freeze-thaw stability of the frozen starch gels, as shown by decreasing degree of syneresis.

Here, the starch characteristics of four rice cultivars (i.e., RD57, RD29, KDML105, and RD6) differing in pasting properties were assessed, and their relationship was determined. The results revealed that protein and moisture contents and their crystalline type were similar among the four rice starches. However, their molecular compositions and structures (i.e., reducing sugar and amylose contents, amylopectin branch chain-length distributions, granule size and size distribution, and degree of crystallinity) significantly varied among different genotypes, which resulted in distinct swelling, solubility, gelatinization, retrogradation, and hydrolytic resistance properties. The swelling power and gelatinization enthalpy (∆H) were positively correlated with C-type granule and relative crystallinity, but were negatively correlated with amylose content, B-type granule and median particle size (d(0.5)). Conversely, the water solubility and resistant starch content negatively correlated with C-type granule, but positively correlated with amylose content, B-type granule, and d(0.5). The gelatinization onset temperature (To(g)), and retrogradation concluding temperatures (Tc(r)), enthalpy (∆H(r)), and percentage (R%) were positively impacted by the amount of protein, amylose, and B1 chains (DP 13–24), while they were negatively correlated with short A chains (DP 6–12). Collectively, the starch physicochemical and functional properties of these Thai rice starches are attributed to an interplay between compositional and structural features. These results provide decisive and crucial information on rice cultivars’ suitability for consumption as cooked rice and for specific industrial applications.']"

These anatomies are commonly found in mandibular molars, especially in the Mongoloid population. However, there is no report on these anatomies using cone-beam computed tomography on all three mandibular molars in Thais. The objectives of this study were to determine the prevalence of C-shaped canals and three-rooted mandibular molars in Thais and investigate whether there is a relationship between these morphology and gender. Methods and Materials: Three pre-calibrated observers independently determined the presence of each anatomy using a specific protocol in 753 molars from cone-beam computed tomographic images. The three observers randomly re-evaluated 20% of the samples to determine inter- and intra-observer agreement using Cohen’s Kappa statistic. The relationship of these root canal anatomy with sex was analysed by the Chi-square test. Results: The prevalence of C-shaped canals and three-rooted molars was 0.39% and 12.1%, 42.4% and 3.9%, and 16.6% and 9.1% in first, second, and third mandibular molars respectively. The inter-/intra-observer reliability of the results was extremely high. Conclusion: This cross-sectional study showed the prevalence of C-shaped canals in mandibular second molars was relatively high and should be considered normal root canal anatomy in Thais.

Materials and Methods: CBCT images that met the inclusion and exclusion criteria were categorized using a recent classification of AA arch forms and a SRP classification. Then, the angulation of the root axis and the alveolar bone axis was measured using mid-sagittal CBCT images of each tooth. The relationships of the angulation with each AA arch form and SRP classification were evaluated using 1-way analysis of variance and a linear regression model. Results: Ninety-eight CBCT images were included in this study. SRP had a greater influence than the AA arch form on the angulation of the root axis and the alveolar bone axis (P<0.05). However, the combination of AA arch form and SRP was more predictive of the angulation of the root axis and the alveolar bone axis than either parameter individually. Conclusion: The angulation of the root axis and alveolar bone axis demonstrated a relationship with the AA arch form and SRP in teeth in the anterior esthetic region. The influence of SRP was greater, but the combination of both parameters was more predictive of root-to-bone angulation than either parameter individually, implying that clinicians should account for both the AA arch form and SRP when planning implant placement procedures in this region.', 'Associations among the anterior maxillary dental arch form, alveolar bone thickness, and the sagittal root position of the maxillary central incisors in relation to immediate implant placement: A cone-beam computed tomography analysis  2022 by Korean Academy of Oral and Maxillofacial Radiology This is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial License (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0) which permits unrestricted non-commercial use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.Purpose: This study evaluated the associations of the dental arch form, age-sex groups, and sagittal root position (SRP) with alveolar bone thickness of the maxillary central incisors using cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) images.

From these patients, 560 sagittal CBCT images of the maxillary central incisors were examined to measure the labial and palatal bone thickness at the apex level and the palatal bone at the mid-root level, according to the SRP classification. The chi-square test, Kruskal-Wallis test, and multiple linear regression were used for statistical analyses. Results: Significant differences were found in alveolar bone thickness depending on the arch form and SRP at the apex level. The square dental arch form and class I SRP showed the highest bone thickness at both levels of the palatal aspect. The taper dental arch form and class II SRP presented the highest bone thickness at the apex level of the labial aspect. No association was found between the dental arch form and SRP. Elderly women showed a significant association with thinner alveolar bone. Age-sex group, the dental arch form, and SRP had significant associations with alveolar bone thickness at the apex level. Conclusion: The patient’s age-sex group, dental arch form, and SRP were associated with alveolar bone thickness around the maxillary central incisors with varying magnitudes. Therefore, clinicians should take these factors into account when planning immediate implant placement.']"

DNA methylation pattern is tissue specific and has emerged as a biomarker for the detection of cancers of tissue origin. Herein, we aimed to discover a novel site-specific methylation marker for OSCC. Methods: We selected OSCC datasets analyzed using the IlluminaHumanMethylation27 BeadChip from the Gene Expression Omnibus repository of the National Center for Biotechnology Information using a bioinformatics approach. From 27,578 CG dinucleotide (CpG) sites, the CpG site with the highest difference in methylation level between healthy and cancerous cells was selected for further validation. A total of 18 mucosal tissue samples were collected from nine healthy controls and nine from OSCC subjects and subjected to microdissection for cell purification, followed by DNA extraction, bisulfite conversion, and pyrosequencing. Additionally, epithelial cells were collected from 2 cohorts including oral rinse from healthy controls, oral rinse and oral swab from OSCC subjects and oral rinse from oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) were examined for their methylation status using real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Results: Among the 27,578 differentially methylated CpG sites, cg01009664 of the thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) gene showed the greatest difference in methylation level between healthy and cancerous cells. Validation of the TRH gene using pyrosequencing revealed a methylation percentage of 7% ± 3.43% in healthy cells in contrast to 63% ± 19.81% in cancerous cells.

This gene was then validated by a quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. The results showed that ZCCHC6 was expressed at significantly higher levels in the patients with HNSCC than in the healthy controls, and the sensitivity and specificity of these findings for diagnostic purposes were 100.00% and 70.83%, respectively.

To evaluate the effect in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), LINE-1 methylation levels and patterns have been measured both in vitro and in vivo. Methods: Analysis of LINE-1 methylation in cocultured models between HNSCC cell lines and normal PBMCs was performed. The observation of PBMCs of HNSCC patients compared to PBMCs of normal controls was performed using the semiquantitative combined bisulfite restriction analysis technique. Results: Downregulation of LINE-1 methylation was significantly found in the PBMCs cocultured with all HNSCC cell lines compared to normal PBMCs. Likewise, a reduction in LINE-1 methylation levels was observed in PBMCs of HNSCC compared to normal PBMCs (p < 0.0001). Receiver operating characteristic analysis demonstrated the potential of the unmethylated alleles (uCuC) of LINE-1 for distinguishing the PBMCs of HNSCC patients from normal controls with 100% sensitivity and specificity. Conclusion: Our data supported that the alteration of LINE-1 methylation levels in PBMCs was influenced by HNSCC secretions. Moreover, the unmethylated LINE-1 allele of PBMCs was proved to be an effective tumor marker and possesses a potential as HNSCC diagnostic tool.']"

Its prevalence is rising worldwide. The primary objective of this study was to evaluate sexual function in transgender women after gender-affirming surgery using penile skin inversion vaginoplasty. The secondary objectives were to evaluate the most affected domain of the FSFI (female sexual function index) and quality of life (QOL) of these participants. Methods: This was a cross-sectional study. The data was collected from 69 transgender women who have undergone penile skin inversion vaginoplasty ≥ 3 months prior to the study initiation. The participants were requested to fill out two questionnaires, the FSFI and WHOQOL-BREF. Sexual dysfunction was diagnosed in transgender women with FSFI score ≤ 26 that is traditionally classified as sexual dysfunction. Results: Eighty-two percent (82.61%) of participants reported a total FSFI score of less than 26. The mean total FSFI score was 22.95, with the lowest score in lubrication domain. However, poor quality of life by WHOQOL-BREF was present in only 2.9% of the tested participants. Conclusions: This study found a significant prevalence of sexual dysfunction by FSFI score in the transgender women who have undergone gender-affirming surgery using penile skin inversion. Quality of life by WHOQOL-BREF score was, however, generally high in this population.

Design/methodology/approach: A cross-sectional study was conducted among 280 transgender women in Bangkok, Thailand between March 2019 and May 2019 using the snowball sampling method. Data were collected through a self-administered questionnaire. The questionnaire included demographic questions and measures of social support (MSPSS) and depression (CES-D). Multivariable logistic regression analysis was employed to explore the association between social support and depression. Findings: The prevalence of depression among transgender women was 58.2%. Multivariable logistic regression analysis indicated that depression was significantly associated with perceived low social support (OR: 9.55, 95%CI: 2.10–43.39) and moderate social support (OR: 2.03, 95%CI: 1.19–3.46) after being adjusted for religion, sufficient income and alcohol drinking. Originality/value: Transgender women were prone to experience a higher prevalence of depression than the general population. Social support would reduce the risk of depression among transgender women. Therefore, social support service systems for transgender women should be embedded into organizations concerned."", 'A cross-sectional research on factors associated with depression among transgender women in Bangkok, Thailand  BEIESP.Depression is becoming a major mental health problem globally. Thailand is known as the accepting society for transgender but the available study on transgender women dealing with depression is scarce. This study aims to describe the prevalence of depression among Thai transgender women in Bangkok and to explore the associated factors. A cross-sectional study was conducted among 108 Thai transgender women in Bangkok, Thailand from January 2019 to April 2019. Data were collected through self-administered. Depression was assessed by using The Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression Scale (CES-D). Multivariate regression analysis was conducted to explore the associated factors of depression. The prevalence of depression among transgender women in this study was 54.6%. Factors associated with depression in the crude analysis were: sex reassignment surgery (OR=2.45, 95%CI=0.96-6.24), illness history (OR=1.79, 95%CI=0.72-4.50). In multivariate logistic regression analysis, depression was significantly associated with drinking alcohol >1 time/month in the past 12months (adjusted OR=0.33, 95%CI=0.12-0.91). Transgender tend to experience higher rates of mental health issues than the general population. This study suggested that alcohol drinking was only significantly associated with depression in Thai transgender women. For further study, we need to find other associations with depression in transgender community.']"

The cultural elements are found to be superficially universal in that they retain the language used in the guidelines found in the west but contain interestingly unique cultural elements when probed deeper. For example, many non-western guidelines have an injunction “Be ethical” without specifying the content of the ethical in question. We present an analysis of this and other unique aspects of the non-western guidelines in terms of broad cultural traditions that inform the guidelines and their drafters. This leads to a normative argument that what is understood to be universal in intercultural ethics is in fact based on the desire of many cultures to live and work together, and not, as ethical universalists seem to argue, on some culture-transcendent standard of morality.', 'The moral malaise of modernity: Codes of conduct, authenticity, lifelong learning and the case of Thailand  2019 Kasetsart University.It is argued in this paper that the project of modernity has not only undermined commitment to traditional frameworks of morality or ethics but has also failed to provide any ethical frameworks sufficiently persuasive to replace that loss. Contemporary modernist culture has become what may be seen as a culture of instrumentalist individualism, in which morality is increasingly individualised and contextualised, creating moral conflict and uncertainty: the moral malaise of modernity. The development of situated codes of conduct or ethics has become a standard response to that moral malaise. They are, though, insufficient foundations for ethical or moral practice, since they fail to provide a conception of the goal or telos of ethics, from which may be drawn a compelling purpose for being ethical. An alternative response to the moral malaise of modernity, though, is to recognise and encourage the development of an ethic of authenticity, which would seem to provide a moral telos and in which lifelong learning is a core dimension - suggesting the centrality of lifelong learning engagement in the on-going search for ethical authenticity. Such an ethic may be seen as an emergent feature of contemporary modernity, but as more congruent with cultures - such as that of Thailand - where individual authenticity has strong traditional foundations and links with lifelong learning. That tentative idea is here examined and assessed. It is concluded, though, that contemporary Thai culture is unlikely to provide a particularly fertile site for the fuller development of an ethic of authenticity.', 'Normativity in Buddhism and Its Application in Bioethics  2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.This paper argues that normativity in Buddhism is constituted by a thoroughgoing kind of naturalism and teleology. An action is good in Buddhism only if it is conducive to the main goal of being a Buddhist, that is, becoming released from sufferings or dissatisfactory conditions (dukkha) thereby gaining a release from the bondage of the cycle of life, death and rebirth (saṃsāra). This is a sketch of an ethical theory that I call ethical teleological naturalism. The theory is also pragmatic in nature because the emphasis lies on how to achieve the desired goal. Buddhist ethics is also strongly connected to Buddhist metaphysics and epistemology because in order to gain liberation from the cycle one needs to gain full knowledge of what ultimate reality is like. This interpretation of Buddhist ethical thought is thus akin to that of Damien Keown in one respect, namely that the Buddhist theory is comparable in many ways to ancient Greek ethical theory, but Keown sees Buddhist theory to be similar to virtue ethics whereas I see the theory to be more akin to Stoicism as well as Spinoza’s ethical theory. The latter half of the paper discusses how this pragmatic and teleological nature of Buddhist normative theory plays out in bioethics. This is done through a look at a recent debate among two prominent scholars of Buddhist philosophy, Damien Keown and Rupert Gethin, on euthanasia.']"

Therefore, the productivity of shale gas is closely related to the reservoir parameters making it very important to understand the characteristics of shale reservoirs. In this study, the production data of Montney shale was analyzed and the impact of the reservoir characteristics on the productivity was quantified. The reservoir characteristics can be divided into the reservoir quality (RQ) and completion quality (CQ) parameters. The productivity of shale gas, which is defined as the production decline variables, such as the peak monthly rate (PMR), the initial decline rate, and the decline exponent, was compared with the RQ and CQ. Among the CQ parameters, the brittleness index (BI) was found to affect the overall decline trend in production and had a qualitative correlation with the initial decline rate and decline exponent. Moreover, among the RQ, the total organic carbon (TOC) is closely related to the PMR and the amount of organic carbon (S1) already generated as hydrocarbon is strongly correlated with the initial decline rate and the decline exponent, especially in the transient linear flow regime. Therefore, it is possible to quantify the effects of the organic carbon contents on the productivity of shale gas and estimate the production in the transient linear flow regime.', ""A new decline curve analysis method for layered reservoirs  2019, Society of Petroleum Engineers.This study presents a new method to improve production forecasts and reserves estimation for a multilayer well in the early stages of production, using Arps' hyperbolic decline method to model the decline rate of each layer. The method can be applied to both oil and gas wells. The new approach generates the profiles of instantaneous decline rate (D) and instantaneous decline exponent (b) from the historical flow rate (q). Because of the inherent noise in the production data, a regression technique is applied to smooth the flow rate data and the analysis is performed on the smoothed data. History matching is performed not only on the profile of q, but also on the profiles of D and b. The results are the unique decline parameters (qi, Di, and b) for each layer. For a multi-layer well, the values of D and b vary with time, which means that its performance cannot be modeled using a conventional single-layer well approach. Furthermore, the well-known non-uniqueness problem from history matching is magnified in a multilayer well: many models can successfully match the production profile in the short term but fail to match it in the longer term. Only the correct model can match the profiles of q, D, and b over both the short-term and the long-term. The proposed method provides the correct unique decline parameters (qi, Di, and b) for each layer, during the early stage of production, and these parameters are then valid for the life of the well. The method works well for both synthetic examples and actual field data. The novelty of the new methodology is the ability to provide the decline parameters for each layer at an early stage of production, which can then be used for production forecasting in the long term. The non-uniqueness problem from history matching is solved."", ""A straight line P/Z plot in multilayer tight gas reservoirs Copyright 2019, Society of Petroleum Engineers.Application of conventional material balance methods to evaluate multilayer tight gas reservoirs gives misleading results. This is due to the phenomenon differential depletion, as a result of which very long shut-in times are required to get the correct average reservoir pressure, and pressures from static BHP surveys are generally significantly lower than the average reservoir pressure. This study proposes a new approach which yields a straight line on the p/z plot, without a long shut-in period. This paper proposes to use data from production logging which can be used to perform selective inflow performance (SIP) analysis. From SIP the pressure and productivity of each reservoir can be estimated independently. The average reservoir pressure of the multilayer system can then be calculated from each layer's reservoir pressure weighted by its hydrocarbon pore volume. The method therefore requires estimation of the hydrocarbon pore volume ratio (Fv). A guideline for Fv estimation and the effects of Fv on the p/z plot will be discussed in this study. With this new average reservoir pressure, material balance methods will give a straight line, similar to one for a single layer gas reservoir. Without loss of generality, this study focuses on a 2-layer gas reservoir: a high-permeability layer (layer 1) and a low-permeability layer (layer 2). The results can be applied to multilayer gas reservoirs. Fv is defined here as the ratio of the hydrocarbon pore volume (HCPV) of layer 1 to the HCPV of layer 2. For a given Fv, together with individual layer pressures from SIP analysis, the average reservoir pressure can be calculated. Different values of Fv yield different profiles on the p/z plot. A straight line can be obtained only from the correct value of Fv. If the value of Fv is incorrect, the calculated pressure will be deviating from the theoretical straight line. High and low values of Fv lead to underestimation and overestimation of GIIP and reserves, respectively. During the early production period, most of the production is from layer 1 which dominates the early-time response. The differential pressure between layer 2 and layer 1 (p2 – p1) is increasing during this period. After layer 1 is partially depleted, production from layer 2 starts to increase significantly, and dominates the late-time response. The value of (p2 – p1) reaches a maximum and then decreasing. Beyond this point, all profiles for different values of Fv lead to the correct GIIP and reserve. Then the uncertainty will be reduced dramatically. This study should be beneficial to engineers who wish to estimate GIIP and reserves. It is theoretically sound for multilayer gas reservoirs, both tight and high permeability reservoirs, for both with and without cross-flow. With this new approach, engineers can apply material balance methods to better understand multilayer gas reservoirs and to make better reservoir management decisions.""]"

Its traditional used to treat many ailments, including various types of cancers, health promotion, and longevity. Aims: To evaluate the ability of an aqueous extract Triphala (TPL) to inhibit the growth of Hepatocellular carcinoma cells (HepG2) and in mice. Methods: The anticancer activity of TPL and its composite extracts was assessed in vitro by MTT assay with HepG2 cells. The mice were inoculated with HepG2 cells and then divided randomly into six groups (6 mice/group): control group, positive control group (intraperitoneal with 3 mg/kg body weight doxorubicin), and TPL treatment groups (oral administrated with 50, 100, and 200 mg/kg body weight TPL, respectively). Anticancer activity based on body weight, tumor growth volumes, survival time, relative organ weight, and hematological parameters was determined after administrating the TPL for 14 consecutive days. Results: The results demonstrated that the TPL extract exhibited antiproliferative activity against HepG2 cells in a time-dependent manner of treatment. The selectivity index (SI) showed that TPL is highly selective (SI>3) against the HepG2 cell line and has no activity against non-tumor cells. Oral administration with TPL extract at the dose of 200 mg/kg body weight inhibited tumor growth volume and increase the survival time.

Results: Levels of IL-6, NO, and ROS in LPS-treated BV2 cells were significantly higher than those in control (p < 0.01). However, exposure of LPS-treated BV2 cells to O. indicum extract led to a marked decrease in the levels of these parameters, when compared to the untreated cells (p < 0.01).

The genetic diversity of Blastocystis spp. might be associated with a wide range of symptoms. However, the prevalence of each subtype is different in each country. Until now, there is no standard method for subtyping of Blastocystis spp. We developed a sequential restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis for the rapid differentiation of human Blastocystis subtypes. A large-scale study was also conducted to determine the subtype distribution of Blastocystis spp. in Thailand. Stool samples were collected from 1025 school-age students in four regions of Thailand. Blastocystis infections were identified by direct smear, formalin ethyl-acetate concentration technique (FECT), Boeck and Drbohlav’s Locke-Egg-Serum (LES) medium culture, and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of small-subunit ribosomal DNA (SSU rDNA). Subtypes of Blastocystis spp. were determined by RFLP. Phylogenetic tree of partial SSU rDNA sequences of Blastocystis spp. was constructed using the Maximum Likelihood (ML) method. Out of 1025 students, 416 (40.6%) were positive for Blastocystis spp. Using two steps of RFLP reactions, we could determine subtype one–three among these students. Subtype 3 was the most common subtype (58.72%) in Thai students, followed by subtype 1 (31.2%), and subtype 2 (10.1%). Blastocystis subtype 3 was the most prevalent in all regions of Thailand.

This cross-sectional study was conducted between February and September 2016 in three suburban government primary schools (KK, BR, and HK), Saraburi, Thailand. Stool was collected from 263 asymptomatic subjects (4-15 years old), using simple direct smear, formalin-ether concentration, Boeck and Drbohlav’s Locke-Egg-Serum (LES) medium culture, and agar plate culture. A self-administered questionnaire was used to collect data about lifestyle and socioeconomic status. The overall rate of intestinal parasites was 22.1% (15.6% single infection and 6.5% multiple infections). The helminths involving the digestive system found were Strongyloides stercoralis (1.5%) and Opisthorchis viverrini (0.4%). For protozoan infection, the major cause was Blastocystis hominis (17.5%). The other protozoa included Endolimax nana (4.6%), Entamoeba coli (3.4%), Entamoeba histolytica/Entamoeba dispar (1.1%), and Giardia intestinalis (0.8%). The sensitivity for the detection of B. hominis increased with the LES culture technique. The infection rate of each organism was not significantly different among the three schools except for B. hominis which showed the highest prevalence in the HK school (P = 0.001). This was correlated with the questionnaire results in which the HK school showed the highest risk of drinking contaminated water (P = 0.004). The present study emphasized the persistent problems of protozoan infections among suburban school-aged children. Lifestyle was still an important factor for intestinal parasitic infections among suburban school-aged Thai children in this study.

The present study was performed to examine the effects of SpO2 and PBT during acute infection on immune, oxidative and nitrosative stress (IO&NS) pathways and neuropsychiatric symptoms of Long COVID. This study assayed SpO2 and PBT during acute COVID-19, and C-reactive protein (CRP), malondialdehyde (MDA), protein carbonyls (PCs), myeloperoxidase (MPO), nitric oxide (NO), zinc, and glutathione peroxidase (Gpx) in 120 Long COVID individuals and 36 controls. Cluster analysis showed that 31.7% of the Long COVID patients had severe abnormalities in SpO2, body temperature, increased oxidative toxicity (OSTOX) and lowered antioxidant defenses (ANTIOX), and increased total Hamilton Depression (HAMD) and Anxiety (HAMA) and Fibromylagia-Fatigue (FF) scores. Around 60% of the variance in the neuropsychiatric symptoms of Long COVID (a factor extracted from HAMD, HAMA and FF scores) was explained by OSTOX/ANTIOX ratio, PBT and SpO2. Increased PBT predicted increased CRP and lowered ANTIOX and zinc levels, while lowered SpO2 predicted lowered Gpx and increased NO production. Lowered SpO2 strongly predicts OSTOX/ANTIOX during Long COVID. In conclusion, the impact of acute COVID-19 on the symptoms of Long COVID is partly mediated by OSTOX/ANTIOX, especially lowered Gpx and zinc, increased MPO and NO production and lipid peroxidation-associated aldehyde formation.

The severity of the long COVID physio-affective phenome is largely predicted by increased peak body temperature (BT) and lowered oxygen saturation (SpO2) during the acute infectious phase. This study aims to delineate whether the association of BT and SpO2 during the acute phase and the long COVID physio-affective phenome is mediated by neurotoxicity (NT) resulting from activated immune-inflammatory and oxidative stress pathways. Methods: We recruited 86 patients with long COVID (3–4 months after the acute phase) and 39 healthy controls and assessed serum C-reactive protein (CRP), caspase 1, interleukin (IL) 1β, IL-18, IL-10, myeloperoxidase (MPO), advanced oxidation protein products (AOPPs), total antioxidant capacity (TAC), and calcium (Ca), as well as peak BT and SpO2 during the acute phase. Results: Cluster analysis revealed that a significant part (34.9%) of long COVID patients (n = 30) show a highly elevated NT index as computed based on IL-1β, IL-18, caspase 1, CRP, MPO, and AOPPs. Partial least squares analysis showed that 61.6% of the variance in the physio-affective phenome of long COVID could be explained by the NT index, lowered Ca, and peak BT/SpO2 in the acute phase and prior vaccinations with AstraZeneca or Pfizer. The most important predictors of the physio-affective phenome are Ca, CRP, IL-1β, AOPPs, and MPO. Conclusion: The infection–immune–inflammatory core of acute COVID-19 strongly predicts the development of physio-affective symptoms 3–4 months later, and these effects are partly mediated by neuro-immune and neuro-oxidative pathways.', 'Lowered Quality of Life in Long COVID Is Predicted by Affective Symptoms, Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, Inflammation and Neuroimmunotoxic Pathways  2022 by the authors.The physio-affective phenome of Long COVID-19 is predicted by (a) immune-inflammatory biomarkers of the acute infectious phase, including peak body temperature (PBT) and oxygen saturation (SpO2), and (b) the subsequent activation of immune and oxidative stress pathways during Long COVID. The purpose of this study was to delineate the effects of PBT and SpO2 during acute infection, as well as the increased neurotoxicity on the physical, psychological, social and environmental domains of health-related quality of life (HR-QoL) in people with Long COVID. We recruited 86 participants with Long COVID and 39 normal controls, assessed the WHO-QoL-BREF (World Health Organization Quality of Life Instrument-Abridged Version, Geneva, Switzerland) and the physio-affective phenome of Long COVID (comprising depression, anxiety and fibromyalgia-fatigue rating scales) and measured PBT and SpO2 during acute infection, and neurotoxicity (NT, comprising serum interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-18 and caspase-1, advanced oxidation protein products and myeloperoxidase, calcium and insulin resistance) in Long COVID. We found that 70.3% of the variance in HR-QoL was explained by the regression on the physio-affective phenome, lowered calcium and increased NT, whilst 61.5% of the variance in the physio-affective phenome was explained by calcium, NT, increased PBT, lowered SpO2, female sex and vaccination with AstraZeneca and Pfizer. The effects of PBT and SpO2 on lowered HR-QoL were mediated by increased NT and lowered calcium yielding increased severity of the physio-affective phenome which largely affects HR-QoL. In conclusion, lowered HR-Qol in Long COVID is largely predicted by the severity of neuro-immune and neuro-oxidative pathways during acute and Long COVID.']"

Thieme. All rights reserved.Objectives Endoscopic endonasal approaches (EEAs) for petrosectomies are evolving to reduce perioperative brain injuries and complications. Surgical terminology, techniques, landmarks, advantages, and limitations of these approaches remain ill defined. We quantitatively analyzed the anatomical relationships and differences between EEA exposures for medial, inferior, and inferomedial petrosectomies. Design This study presents anatomical dissection and quantitative analysis. Setting Cadaveric heads were used for dissection. EEAs were performed using the medial petrosectomy (MP), the inferior petrosectomy (IP), and the inferomedial petrosectomy (IMP) techniques. Participants Six cadaver heads (12 sides, total) were dissected; each technique was performed on four sides. Main Outcomes and Measures Outcomes included the area of exposure, visible distances, angles of attack, and bone resection volume. Results The IMP technique provided a greater area of exposure (p < 0.01) and bone resection volume (p < 0.01) when compared with the MP and IP techniques. The IMP technique had a longer working length of the abducens nerve (cranial nerve [CN] VI) than the MP technique (p < 0.01). The IMP technique demonstrated higher angles of attack to specific neurovascular structures when compared with the MP (midpons [ p = 0.04], anterior inferior cerebellar artery [ p < 0.01], proximal part of the cisternal CN VI segment [ p = 0.02]) and IP (flocculus [ p = 0.02] and the proximal [ p = 0.02] and distal parts [ p = 0.02] of the CN VII/VIII complex) techniques. Conclusion Each of these approaches offers varying degrees of access to the petroclival region, and the surgical approach should be appropriately tailored to the pathology. Overall, the IMP technique provides greater EEA surgical exposure to vital neurovascular structures than the MP and the IP techniques.', ""Recreating the microscopic direct access Draf 2a frontal sinusotomy in the endoscopic era and comparison to an angled instrument approach  2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.Purpose: Microscopic Draf 2a frontal sinusotomy relied on direct access. However, the modern-day endoscopic approach is hindered by the anterior–posterior dimensions of the frontal recess. The nasofrontal beak, angled endoscopes, and variable frontal recess anatomy make the surgery challenging. Carolyn's window frontal sinusotomy removes the limitation of anterior–posterior dimensions and is an endoscopic version of the microscopic Draf 2a. This study aims to compare the perioperative outcomes and morbidity from endoscopic direct access Draf 2a compared to angled access Draf 2a. Methods: Consecutive adult patients (> 18 years) seen at a tertiary referral clinic who underwent Draf 2a frontal sinus surgery using either endoscopic direct access (Carolyn’s window) or endoscopic angled instrumentation were included. Patients who underwent Carolyn's window were compared to those with angled Draf 2a frontal sinusotomy. Results: One hundred patients (age 51.96 ± 15.85 years, 48.0% female, follow-up 60.75 ± 17.34 months) were included. 44% of patients used Carolyn's window approach. 100% [95% CI 98.2–100%] of patients achieved successful frontal sinus patency. Both groups were comparable for early morbidities (bleeding, pain, crusting, and adhesions) and late morbidities (retained frontal recess partitions). There were no other morbidities in the early and late postoperative periods. Conclusion: The endoscopic direct access Draf 2a, or Carolyn’s window, removes the anteroposterior diameter limitation. The frontal sinus patency and early and late surgical morbidities of direct access Draf 2a were comparable with the angled Draf 2a frontal sinusotomy. Surgical modifications, often with drills and bone removal, can be successfully made to enhance access in endoscopic sinus surgery without concern for additional morbidity."", ""Carolyn's Window Approach to Unilateral Frontal Sinus Surgery  2023 The American Laryngological, Rhinological and Otological Society, Inc.Objectives: Due to the complexity and variety of the frontal recess and sinus anatomy, traditional Draf 2a frontal sinus surgery is challenging. The thickness of the nasofrontal beak and anterior–posterior dimensions of the frontal recess contribute to this complexity. Carolyn's window technique eliminates the limitation of anterior–posterior depth to facilitate a Draf 2a frontal sinusotomy. The approach is a 0° endoscope technique and provides an excellent view of the frontal sinus and recess. We describe Carolyn's window approach to frontal sinus surgery and the perioperative outcomes. Methods: Consecutive adult patients in whom Carolyn's window technique was applied for frontal sinus dissection as part of the endoscopic management of both inflammatory and neoplastic disease were assessed. The primary outcome was frontal sinus patency. Secondary outcomes were surgical morbidity, defined as early (<90 days) or late (>90 days). Results: Forty-five patients (49.1 ± 17.9 years, 48.9% Female) were assessed. All patients had successful frontal sinus patency (100% [95CI: 92.1%–100%]). Morbidities were adhesion (4.8%), crusting (2.4%), pain (1.2%), and bleeding (1.2%) in the early postoperative period. There were no other morbidities in the early and late postoperative periods. Conclusion: Carolyn's window approach to frontal sinusotomy is a technique that evolves from previously described approaches. Successful frontal sinus patency with very low morbidities is achieved while still working with a 0° endoscope. The “axillectomy” performed simplifies frontal recess surgery by removing the anteroposterior diameter limitation and the dexterity required in angled endoscopy and instrumentation. The inferior-based lateral wall mucosal flap and free mucosal grafting expedite the mucosal healing process. Laryngoscope, 2023.""]"

The catalytic performance and sulfur resistance of the prepared Pd-Pt/MCM-41 catalysts were strongly associated with the Pd/Pt weight ratio. When H-FAME was synthesized at 100 °C and 0.4 MPa of H2 for 4 h, the 1 wt.% Pd-Pt/MCM-41 (1:1) showed high hydrogenation activity (turnover frequency of 195 h−1 and rate constant of 3.97 × 10−1 h−1gcat−1) with the lowest degree of oversaturation of 4.8 at high conversion of C18:2, and strong resistance to the sulfur species as a poison added to the feedstock.

These purpose-made Pd/SBA-15 catalysts are applied in the partial hydrogenation of soybean-oil-derived biodiesel fuel, rich in polyunsaturated fatty acid methyl esters (poly-FAME), to produce partially hydrogenated fatty acid methyl esters (H-FAME), rich in monounsaturated fatty acid methyl esters (mono-FAME), under mild conditions (80 °C, 0.5 MPa H2). The Pd particle size was strongly correlated with hydrogenation rate and selectivity, thereby influencing the composition and fuel properties of H-FAME. The Pd/SBA-15 catalyst with a Pd particle size of approximately 4 nm obtained by calcination at 300 °C in O2 showed the highest initial hydrogenation rate and mono-FAME selectivity. The resulting H-FAME product was rich in mono-FAME and thus exhibited high oxidative stability and cold-flow properties compliant with high-blend biofuel standards. In contrast, the analog catalysts with Pd particle sizes ranging from 8 to 17 nm obtained by calcination at 300 °C in air and nitrogen and at 500 °C featured lower hydrogenation rates and afforded larger amounts of undesired saturated fatty acid methyl esters. These findings shed light on the effect of the Pd particle size on the hydrogenation of biodiesel and can be readily applied to the hydrogenation of other biofuels.', 'Effect of Pd particle size on activity and cis-trans selectivity in partial hydrogenation of soybean oil-derived FAMEs over Pd/SiO2 catalysts  2020 Elsevier B.V.Partial hydrogenation of soybean oil-derived fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) was performed to improve oxidative stability of biodiesel. The reaction was tested in a semi-batch reactor at 100 °C, 0.4 MPa. The effect of Pd particle size on activity and cis-trans selectivity was investigated over SiO2- and MCM-41-supported Pd catalysts, with different Pd loadings (0.5 and 1 wt.%). For Pd/SiO2 catalysts with relatively large Pd particle sizes (6.1–7.8 nm), the adsorption of polyunsaturated C18:2 and C18:3 FAMEs was promoted on the flat metal surface, providing 2- to 3-fold higher turnover frequency (TOF) compared with Pd/MCM-41 catalysts. In contrast, the Pd/MCM-41 catalysts with relatively small Pd particle sizes (2.7–4.0 nm), showed higher selectivity towards the desired monounsaturated C18:1 FAMEs due to lower affinity of isolated double bond (presented in C18:1) on the Pd surface. In addition, selectivity towards the desired cis-C18:1 FAMEs was found to be highly sensitive to Pd particle size. The 0.5Pd/MCM-41 catalyst with small Pd particle size (2.7 nm), provided high cis-C18:1 selectivity, resulting in a biodiesel with better cold flow property compared with the trans-isomers. With partial hydrogenation over the prepared Pd catalysts, biodiesel with significantly improved oxidative stability (>10 h) could be obtained.']"

The objective of this study was to investigate the treatment effects of genistein and running exercise in ovariectomized (OVX) rats with NASH. METHODS: Thirty-six female Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into 6 groups, control; OVX with standard diet; OVX with high fat and high fructose (HFHF) diet for 4 weeks; OVX with HFHF and genistein treatment (16 mg/kg BW/day) for 5 weeks (OVX + HFHF+GEN); OVX with HFHF and moderate intensity exercise for 5 weeks (OVX + HFHF+EX); OVX with HFHF and combined treatments (OVX + HFHF+GEN + EX). Serum interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels, hepatic free fatty acid (FFA), hepatic glutathione (GSH), and hepatic malondialdehyde (MDA) levels were measured. Liver histology was examined to determine NASH severity. RESULTS: OVX + HFHF group had the highest levels of hepatic FFA compared with OVX and control groups (5.92 ± 0.84 vs. 0.37 ± 0.01 vs. 0.42 ± 0.04 nmol/mg protein, respectively, p < 0.01). Serum IL-6 levels were significantly elevated in both OVX and OVX + HFHF groups as compared with controls (112.13 ± 6.50 vs. 121.47 ± 3.96 vs. 86.13 ± 2.40 pg/mL, respectively, p < 0.01). In OVX + HFHF group, hepatic MDA levels were higher, while GSH levels were lower than in OVX and control groups (MDA; 0.98 ± 0.04 vs. 0.82 ± 0.02 vs. 0.78 ± 0.03 nmol/mg protein, and GSH; 46.01 ± 0.91 vs. 55.21 ± 1.40 vs. 57.94 ± 0.32, respectively; p < 0.01 for both). Comparing with OVX + HFHF group, rats that received genistein, exercise and combined treatments demonstrated an improvement in liver histopathology, decreased levels of hepatic FFA (1.44 ± 0.21 vs. 0.45 ± 0.04 vs. 0.49 ± 0.05 nmol/mg protein, respectively, p < 0.01), serum IL-6 (82.80 ± 2.07 vs. 83.47 ± 2.81 vs. 94.13 ± 1.61 pg/mL, respectively, p < 0.01), and hepatic MDA (0.80 ± 0.03 vs. 0.76 ± 0.02 vs. 0.76 ± 0.03 nmol/mg protein, respectively, p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Genistein and moderate intensity exercise were effective in reducing the severity of NASH in OVX rats through the reduction in liver inflammation, oxidative stress and liver fat contents.', 'Genistein-attenuated hepatic steatosis and inflammation in nonalcoholic steatohepatitis with bilateral ovariectomized rats  2018 Pharmacognosy Magazine.

Materials and Methods: Sprague-Dawley female rats (n = 48) were randomly divided into ovariectomized (OVX) and non-OVX groups, then again divided into three subgroups as follows: Controls, rats fed with high-fat high-fructose (HFHF) diet (NASH group), and rats fed with HFHF diet plus daily 16 mg/kg genistein (genistein group). Liver tissues were used for histology, liver tissues were used for histology and measured of hepatic free fatty acid (FFA) by colorimeter, and nuclear factor kappa B (NFκB) expression by immunohistochemistry. Serum tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) was evaluated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Results: NASH group had increased serum TNF-α (171.62 ± 22.34 vs. 58.47 ± 14.83 pg/mL), %NFκB-positive cells (53.94 ± 11.89 vs. 13.73 ± 3.40), and hepatic FFA (9.07 ± 2.27 vs. 3.62 ± 0.77 nmol/mg tissue) when compared with control (P < 0.01). The most severe hepatic fat accumulation and inflammation was found in OVX with NASH group. Genistein treatment decreased serum TNF-α compared with NASH groups in both non-OVX and OVX groups (105.84 ± 29.77 vs. 171.62 ± 22.34 pg/mL and 73.07 ± 19.31 vs. 124.12 ± 16.04 pg/mL, respectively) (P < 0.01). Genistein reduced %NFκB-positive cells in NASH rats (31.84 ± 10.60 vs. 53.94 ± 11.89) and decreased hepatic FFA levels in OVX with NASH rats (6.50 ± 0.60 vs. 13.11 ± 1.65 nmol/mg tissue) when compared with NASH group, respectively (P < 0.01). Conclusion: Estrogen deficiency is the contributing factor that worsens NASH. Genistein attenuated hepatic fat accumulation and inflammation. Moreover, genistein demonstrated to be more effective in estrogen deficiency with NASH than ovary-intact rats.', 'Genistein modulated lipid metabolism, hepatic PPARγ, and adiponectin expression in bilateral ovariectomized rats with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH)  2020 by the authors.

Female Sprague–Dawley rats (n = 48) were divided into ovariectomized (OVX) and non-OVX groups. Each group was then sub-divided into 3 subgroups; control, NASH (rats fed with a high-fat, high-fructose (HFHF) diet), and NASH+Gen (rats fed with HFHF diet plus daily genistein at 16 mg/kg BW). Results showed that HFHF diet induced liver fat accumulation in both non-OVX and OVX rats, which was evidenced by hepatic steatosis on liver pathology and increased hepatic free fatty acid (FFA) and triglyceride levels. Hepatic fat accumulation was significantly more severe in NASH rats with OVX than non-OVX. Hepatocyte apoptosis was more severe in NASH groups compared with that in control groups. Genistein administration significantly improved histopathology of NASH in both non-OVX and OVX rats and attenuated hepatic lipid accumulation, oxidative stress, and hepatocyte apoptosis. Genistein also down-regulated PPARγ and up-regulated adiponectin expression. In summary, NASH could be worsened by estrogen deficiency, indicating the protective action of estrogen on NASH. Genistein administration alleviated hepatic steatosis and apoptosis through the down-regulation of PPARγ and up-regulation of adiponectin expression.']"

The purpose of this paper is to evaluate sustainable migration and development in an integrative manner, including economic, social and environmental perspectives linking theoretical frameworks with empirical evidence in Thailand. Design/methodology/approach: A framework of migration and sustainable development was developed in a structured and integrative manner, and the shift in migration and development patterns in Thailand was examined from an empirical and theoretical standpoint. Findings: Migration contributes to Thailand’s economy in many ways. Migrant workers help to grow the economy, especially in labor-intensive sectors. This helps reduced income inequalities at the household level through remittances. Climate change will enhance migration, especially from neighboring countries and within Thailand itself, thus helping to reduce poverty and income inequality. Possible economic gains from migration, as well as circulating workers and international retirement migrants are highlighted. Research limitations/implications: Only studies published in English or Thai were included, which may have resulted in the omission of some research. A need for rethinking policy design and implementation as a source of sustainable development is required.

Data were analysed using thematic synthesis (e.g. coding, categorisation, synthesis and summarisation). Findings: The review suggested that free movement from CLMV countries is the cause of the mass exodus of unskilled migration to high-income countries. The review found that the free flow of migration policy in the AEC Blueprint 2015 is associated with illegal, unauthorised and unskilled workers in the host country. Research limitations/implications: A systematic review is qualitative in nature, in which the relevant existing literature lacks some empirical studies, and the results must be generalisable. Practical implications: The current systematic review provides a visual diagram for practical implications to isolate undocumented, illegal, unpermitted and unskilled migrant workers and further reduce the mass exodus of migration from CLMV countries.

For decades, this large number of migrant workers from Myanmar has benefited the Thailand-Myanmar border trade, both directly and indirectly, including the remittances that Burmese migrant workers send to their families back home. This paper studies how the economic activities revolving around border trade developed. It describes how informal remittances from Myanmar migrant workers have become one of the key elements of the massive illicit border trade and intro-duces the possibility of digital technology replacing traditional informal remittance methods. The data presented here was collected by way of semi-structured interviews with 32 Burmese migrant workers living and working in Samutsakorn Province, nine Thai border traders in Mae Sot, officials, and a Thai financial technology company operating in Myanmar. The interviews revealed that most of the migrant workers had experience using mobile banking and financial applications, they were familiar with the technology, and they were aware of its capacity as an alternative method of sending money back home. However, many still preferred to use informal banking as it benefited them the most. The border traders interviewed for this paper further confirmed that there was still no threat of consequences for payment offsetting. Therefore, the digitalization of banking strengthens the informal banking system as it both hastens and improves the processes of money distribution.']"

Our analyses consisted of three choices of treatment (conventional therapy, infliximab originator, and biosimilar) and three treatment scenarios (infliximab 2 years and 3 years if relapse, infliximab 2 years and lifelong if relapse, and infliximab lifelong). The input parameters were obtained from the CD registry and systematic literature reviews. The results were reported as incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) in 2017 USD per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained. The sensitivity analyses were performed to assess the influence of parameter uncertainty. Threshold sensitivity analyses were carried out to determine the optimal drug prices. Finally, budget impact analyses were conducted. Results: None of the scenarios was cost-effective at Thai willingness-to-pay threshold (4,706 USD/QALY gained). The lowest ICER of 30,121 USD/QALY gained was reported in the scenario that included only standard dose of infliximab biosimilar with the maximum of 5-year treatment. The drug prices need to be reduced by at least 72% to allow infliximab biosimilar to be cost-effective. The 5-year budget impact was only 695,958 USD for the current biosimilar price. Conclusions: Infliximab for the treatment of refractory moderate-to-severe CD in Thailand would be cost-effective if the drug prices were significantly decreased. The best value for money strategy was infliximab biosimilar with a restricted duration of treatment.Key points The use of infliximab and its biosimilar in a restricted duration of maximum 5-year is not cost-effective for patients with moderate-to-severe Crohn’s disease refractory to conventional therapy, unless their price was lowered around 72–90% in Thailand. The estimated budget impact for adopting infliximab or its biosimilar for such indication has potential financial feasibility. Policy makers may consider cost-effectiveness and budget impact findings as well as other aspects such as rarity of disease as a part of the decision making process.', 'Safety and effectiveness of intravenous CT-P13 in inflammatory arthritis: post-marketing surveillance study in Thailand Background: The infliximab biosimilar CT-P13 was approved in Thailand in 2015. Methods: This open-label, multicenter, post-marketing surveillance study evaluated the safety (events of special interest [ESIs]; primary end point) and effectiveness of 46 weeks of CT-P13 treatment according to routine practice in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), ankylosing spondylitis (AS), or psoriatic arthritis (PsA), with 1 year follow-up post-treatment. Results: 30 patients were enrolled (16 RA, 8 AS and 6 PsA). Infections were the most frequently reported study drug-related ESIs (2 RA and 2 AS). One patient with RA and one with PsA experienced infusion-related reactions. No cases of tuberculosis, malignancy (as expected, given 1 year follow-up), or drug-induced liver disease were reported. Disease activity improved across indications. Conclusion: CT-P13 was well tolerated and effective across indications.Infliximab is one biological medicine used to treat inflammatory diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis (RA), ankylosing spondylitis (AS) and psoriatic arthritis (PsA). CT-P13 is a near-identical copy, called a biosimilar, of the original (‘reference’) version of infliximab. CT-P13 is the first biosimilar to receive regulatory approval for treatment of the same three diseases from the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and US Food and Drug Administration. Biosimilarity means that CT-P13 does not differ from the original version of infliximab in clinically important ways, such as how safe it is and how well it works. CT-P13 and reference infliximab provided similar symptom relief during previous clinical trials, and both drugs caused similar side effects. It is important to monitor the safety and performance of CT-P13 when given during routine clinical practice, and in different ethnic populations, such as through the study reported here. Following regulatory approval in Thailand, 30 patients prescribed CT-P13 during routine clinical practice participated in this study. The study included 16 patients with RA, eight with AS and six with PsA. The patients took CT-P13 for 46 weeks and were monitored for a further year. Side effects of CT-P13 were as expected based on previous experience and did not raise any safety concerns. Based on the known safety profile of CT-P13, the study looked at some side effects in particular: infections were the most common of these side effects, experienced by 16 patients overall (seven patients with RA, five patients with AS and four patients with PsA). CT-P13 improved symptoms for all of the diseases. The study suggests that CT-P13 can be given safely and reduces symptoms in Thai patients with AS, RA or PsA.

Khok Sung in Northeastern Thailand is a late Middle Pleistocene terrace deposit, tentatively dated either as 213 ka or 188 ka, yielding 15 described mammalian taxa with especially abundant and complete fossil remains. To investigate paleodiets and habitats of these ancient mammals and to understand the corresponding regional climate, we performed an analysis of stable carbon and oxygen isotopes extracted from tooth enamel carbonate of various mammalian taxa, coupled with the cenogram method. The enamel δ13C values of Khok Sung mammals indicate a variety of diets, ranging from pure C3 to C4 plants, suggesting that C4 grasses were a major component of local Thai ecosystems during the late Middle Pleistocene. The stable isotopic distinction between C3 and C4 plants suggests that the Pleistocene wildlife habitats ranged from closed forests to open grasslands for the Khok Sung area. Moreover, differences within sympatric Pleistocene herbivores such as proboscideans, rhinoceroses, and cervids characterize possible niche partitioning by minimizing interspecific overlap. Paleoclimatic interpretations based on the intra-tooth variability in enamel δ18O values from large mammals and on the cenogram analysis reflect significant seasonal variations in precipitation and temperature, and humid conditions, for the Khok Sung locality. Compared to modern environments in Thailand, it is apparent that C4-dominated grasslands were more widespread at that time when anthropic impacts on the ecosystems were presumably absent or minimal.', 'Long-Term Isotope Evidence on the Diet and Habitat Breadth of Pleistocene to Holocene Caprines in Thailand: Implications for the Extirpation and Conservation of Himalayan Gorals  Copyright  2020 Suraprasit, Jaeger, Shoocongdej, Chaimanee, Wattanapituksakul and Bocherens.Three taxa within the subfamily Caprinae (Himalayan goral Naemorhedus goral, Chinese goral Naemorhedus griseus, and Sumatran serow Capricornis sumatraensis) live in the mountainous upland forests of Southeast Asia, where they are considered as vulnerable or near threatened species. Co-occurrences between these two recognized genera have been documented from some Pleistocene fossil sites in Thailand, suggesting more widely overlapping distribution in the past than today. However, diet and habitat preferences of these Pleistocene and present-day coexisting species have rarely been investigated so far. For the past three decades, stable carbon and oxygen isotope analyses become more commonplace in ecological investigations, allowing us to explore the diets and habitats of ancient and extant animals as well as to reconstruct environmental conditions in the past. We reconstructed diets and habitats of these taxa from five fossil sites in Thailand during the past 400,000 years (from the Middle Pleistocene to the Early Holocene) and from some modern wildlife using the isotopic analysis of carbonate in tooth enamel, in order to test species co-occurrence patterns during the Pleistocene and to examine possible changes of their niche breadths over evolutionary time. Our carbon isotope analysis revealed remarkably different ecological patterns between Naemorhedus and Capricornis. The Pleistocene Sumatran serow has been a greater generalist than both the Himalayan and Chinese gorals that fed on pure C4 or mixed C3 and C4 plants restricted to an open landscape habitat and than its extant population that occupies a closed-canopy forest. This suggests that the habitat contraction of the modern wildlife is likely due to the Holocene climate change and the human impacts on Thai ecosystems. In addition to the loss or reduction of grasslands after the latest Pleistocene when rainforests became dominant and besides the human hunting and predation pressure, the high interspecific competition likely contributed to the extirpation of Himalayan gorals in Thailand. Developing a strategic plan for the future biodiversity conservation, a long-term historical isotope approach allowed us to predict the contrasting habitat suitability, a lowland grassland, for these two threatened goral species as testified by their ecological persistence during the Pleistocene.', 'Taxonomic reassessment of large mammals from the Pleistocene Homo-bearing site of Tham Wiman Nakin (Northeast Thailand): relevance for faunal patterns in mainland Southeast Asia  2020 Elsevier Ltd and INQUATham Wiman Nakin or “Snake Cave” has so far been recognized as being the only late Middle Pleistocene Homo-bearing fauna, dated to older than 169 ka, in mainland Southeast Asia. Since the last two decades, the highly diversified mammal fauna found from this cave has been widely used as standard references for several studies, though the majority of fossil primates, carnivores, and ungulates have never been described in detail. This paper presents taxonomic descriptions of unpublished fossil specimens from the long-known collection of Tham Wiman Nakin. As a result, the fauna of Tham Wiman Nakin consisted of at least 28 large mammal taxa. Although several previously described specimens are re-assigned to different tooth elements and/or mammal taxa, our taxonomic study confirms the existence of most of the species identified from the previous work and describes three additional taxa for the locality: an Asian badger, a tiger, and a Himalayan goral. The Tham Wiman Nakin fauna is one of the most diverse Pleistocene mammals, including a hominin, in mainland Southeast Asia and documents long-term survivors of living species since the late Middle Pleistocene. Based on several recent dates of fossil sites in mainland Southeast Asia, biochronological data imply a possible faunal age up to the maximum of 300 ka for the Tham Wiman Nakin fauna, but younger than that of Pha Bong where Gigantopithecus was present. Fossil records in the region also suggest a relatively stable fauna through Pleistocene glacial-interglacial cycles, at least from the late Middle to latest Pleistocene. The extinction occurring in the mainland varied across taxa and likely resulted in less impacted biodiversity loss prior to the Holocene, compared to other continents, as indicated by the small proportion of species becoming extinct during each interval. The importance of stable mosaic habitats through time may provide clues to the long-term survival of several large mammal taxa in the region.']"

Through the measurement of mechanical properties and a series of ballistic-impact tests that used 7.62 × 51 mm2 projectiles (National Institute of Justice (NIJ), level III), the incorporated MWCNTs were found to enhance the energy-absorption (EAbs) property of the composites, improve ballistic performance, and reduce damage. The perforation process and the ballistic limit (V50) of the composite were also studied via numerical simulation, and the calculated damage patterns were correlated with the experimental results. The result indicated hard armor based on polybenzoxazine nanocomposites could completely protect the perforation of a 7.62 × 51 mm2 projectile at impact velocity range of 847 ± 9.1 m/s.

This study aimed to investigate the antidiabetic, anti-oxidation and cytotoxicity activities of the ethanolic extract of Aquilaria crassna leaves (ACE) and its active metabolite; mangiferin. The yeast α-glucosidase inhibitory assay was performed, and the IC50 of ACE and mangiferin were found to be 0.1840±0.0032 and 0.5714±0.0044 mg/mL, respectively. In addition, these samples were analyzedin term of the in vitro antioxidant activities using standard antioxidant assays. The results showed that ACE and mangiferin do possess anti-oxidant properties. Moreover, the cytotoxicity of ACE and mangiferin was also evaluated against three human cancer cell lines using MTT assay. The ACE could inhibit cell viability of MDA-MB-231; breast cancer cells (IC50 = 33.89±0.50 μg/mL) greater than HT-29; colorectal cancer cells (IC50 =51.74±1.42 μg/mL) and HepG2; hepatic cancer cells (IC50 = 53.63±1.54 μg/mL) Mangiferin could also reduce the viability of these three cell lines, but the IC50 was greater than 100 μg/mL. In conclusion, our findings may provide some evidence for understanding the indigenous use of A. crassna leaves.', 'Pharmacognostic specification and mangiferin content of aquilaria crassna leaves  2018 Phcog.Net.Background: Aquilaria crassna Pierre ex Lecomte (Thymelaeaceae) has been used as a medicinal plant in many aspects. Previous research has revealed that A. crassna leaves contain mangiferin as an active compound. Although the active component has been investigated, the pharmacognostic specification and quantification of mangiferin from A. crassna leaves have never been established. Objective: The current study aimed to conduct and develop a pharmacognostic standard according to WHO guidance as well as the validated method for quantifying mangiferin content. Materials and Methods: Dried A. crassna leaves from 15 separated locations throughout Thailand were investigated for pharmacognostic specification. Their mangiferin contents were quantitatively analysed by TLC densitometry with winCATS software. Results: Macroscopic-, microscopic- characteristics and TLC fingerprinting combined with physicochemical parameters were reported in this study. The loss on drying, moisture content, and total ash content as well as acid-insoluble ash content were determined to be 8.62 ± 0.13, 8.16 ± 0.14, 6.82 ± 0.09 and 1.49 ± 0.03%, respectively. Ethanol- and water-extractive values were found to be 9.05 ± 0.39 and 16.94 ± 0.22 %, respectively. In addition, the validation method for quantifying the mangiferin content was developed. The contents of mangiferin in A. crassna leaf extract determined by TLC-densitometry and TLC-image analysis were found to be 1.2992 ± 0.5980 and 1.3036 ± 0.5874 % by dried weight, respectively. The results between these two analytical methods were shown to have an insignificant difference. Conclusion: This study provides the necessary information for authentication and standardisation of A. crassna leaves.', 'Assessment of the bioactive components, antioxidant, antiglycation and anti-inflammatory properties of Aquilaria crassna Pierre ex Lecomte leaves  2019Aquilaria crassna Pierre ex Lecomte leaf might be a potential source of natural ingredients for anti-ageing cosmetics. Our study objectives were to assess the variation of the bioactive components i.e. iriflophenone 3,5-C-β-D-diglucoside (1), iriflophenone 3-C-β-D-glucoside (2), mangiferin (3) and genkwanin 5-O-β-primevoside (4) in leaves and other parts of the plants collected from different places in Thailand. The bioactivities beneficial for cosmetic uses of A. crassna leaf extracts were explored. The antioxidant activities of the extracts were determined using 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) assays. The antiglycation activities were evaluated using a bovine serum albumin-fructose assay, and the anti-inflammatory activities of the extracts were investigated via the inhibition of interleukin-1α (IL-1α), interleukin-8 (IL-8) and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) secreted from human keratinocyte cells after UVB irradiation. The extracts were also evaluated for nitric oxide (NO) inhibition on lipopolysaccharide-stimulated macrophage cells (RAW 264.7) and lipoxygenase (LOX) inhibition using red ferric thiocyanate assays. The results showed that the young leaves and flowers of A. crassna, contained high total contents of 1–4 of which 3 presented as a major compound. The aqueous and 70% ethanolic extracts of the young leaves showed higher antioxidant activities than that of the mature leaves. The extracts of the young leaves showed antiglycation properties with the half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 5.21 ± 0.54 μg/mL for the 70% ethanolic extracts, where the aqueous extracts of the young leaves had an IC50 value of 9.00 ± 1.38 μg/mL, while a positive standard, aminoguanidine, showed an IC50 value of 9.69 ± 0.75 μg/mL. The anti-inflammatory activities revealed that the aqueous extracts expressed strong IL-1α and IL-8 inhibitions, while the 70% ethanolic extract showed IL-1α and NO inhibitions. Both extracts did not show inhibitory activity on LOX and PGE2. The results suggest that the extracts of young leaves of A. crassna are promising active ingredients for further application in cosmetic and cosmeceutical industry.']"

H2 is mainly produced via the catabolism of stored glycogen under dark anaerobic condition. H2 evolution is catalyzed by O2-sensitive bidirectional hydrogenase. The aim of this study was to improve H2 production by A. halophytica using various kinds of inhibitors. Among all types of inhibitors, simazine efficiently promoted the highest H2 production under dark conditions. High simazine concentration and long-term incubation resulted in a decrease in cell and chlorophyll concentrations. The optimal simazine concentration for H2 production by A. halophytica was 25 µM. Simazine inhibited photosynthetic O2 evolution but promoted dark respiration, resulting in a decrease in O2 level. Hence, the bidirectional hydrogenase activity and H2 production was increased. A. halophytica showed the highest H2 production rate at 58.88 ± 0.22 µmol H2 g−1 dry weight h−1 and H2 accumulation at 356.21 ± 6.04 μmol H2 g−1 dry weight after treatment with 25 µM simazine under dark anaerobic condition for 2 and 24 h, respectively. This study demonstrates the potential of simazine for the enhancement of dark fermentative H2 production by A. halophytica.', 'Enhanced dark fermentative H2 production by agar-immobilized cyanobacterium Aphanothece halophytica  2019, Springer Nature B.V.Cell immobilization is one of the techniques used to improve H2 productivity in cyanobacteria. In this study, H2 production by immobilized cells of unicellular halotolerant cyanobacterium Aphanothece halophytica was investigated and optimized. The results showed that immobilized cells of A. halophytica had higher H2 production than free cells under nitrogen-deprived condition. Among various support material types used, agar-immobilized cells showed the highest H2 production rate. Under nitrogen deprivation, the optimal conditions of cell immobilization for H2 production were 3% (w/v) agar concentration, 0.2 mg dry cell weight per mL of gel solution, and 0.125 cm3 of agar cube. The optimum pH of medium and incubation temperature for H2 production by agar-immobilized cells were pH 7.4 and 40 °C, respectively. Using a large glass vial and headspace volume resulted in enhancement of H2 production by agar-immobilized cells. Finally, H2 production by agar-immobilized cells was analyzed for three consecutive cycles. H2 production could be maintained at the highest level after two cycles when half of immobilized cells were replaced with fresh immobilized cells. These findings indicate that the enhanced H2 production of the unicellular halotolerant cyanobacterium A. halophytica can be achieved by immobilization method, thus providing the possibility to improve H2 production by cyanobacteria in the future.', 'Improvement of photobiological hydrogen production by suspended and immobilized cells of the N2-fixing cyanobacterium Fischerella muscicola TISTR 8215  2019, Springer Nature B.V.To develop H2 photoproduction by using the N2-fixing cyanobacterium Fischerella muscicola TISTR 8215, a novel strain isolated from soil in Thailand, the factors affecting H2 production were investigated in this study. Enhanced H2 production in suspension culture was obtained when adapting the cells under N2-fixing condition (modified AA medium) with continuous illumination of 250 μmol photons m−2 s−1 under aerobic condition for 24 h, followed by further incubation under anaerobic condition for 9 h for production phase. The maximum H2 production rate was 38.5 μmol mg−1 chl a h−1. Low concentration of Fe2+ and Mo6+, essential elements for nitrogenase, enhanced H2 production. The enhanced H2 production was accompanied by the upregulation of nifD. On the other hand, an increased hupL transcript level was observed when there was a decrease of H2 production. In cells immobilization, 1.5% (w/v) agar-immobilized cells had a 23-fold increase in maximum H2 yield compared with that using free cell suspension at the same cell concentration, i.e., 7.48 mmol H2 L−1 by immobilized cells and 0.32 mmol H2 L−1 by suspended cells. Moreover, cell immobilization in agar could prolong H2 production up to 108 h. This study underlines the strategies toward enhanced and sustained H2 production from cyanobacteria. Furthermore, it will pave the way for large-scale production of biohydrogen to be used as an eco-friendly energy resource.']"

This review discusses various factors associated with peri-implantitis and various available treatments, highlighting their advantages and disadvantages. Relevant articles on peri-implantitis published in English were reviewed from August 2010 to April 2020 in MEDLINE/PubMed, Scopus, and ScienceDirect. The identified risk indicators of peri-implant diseases are plaque, smoking, history of periodontitis, surface roughness, residual cement, emergence angle >30 degrees, radiation therapy, keratinized tissue width, and function time of the implant, sex, and diabetes. Peri-implantitis treatments can be divided into nonsurgical (mechanical, antiseptic, and antibiotics), surface decontamination (chemical and laser), and surgical (air powder abrasive, resective, and regenerative). However, mechanical debridement alone may fail to eliminate the causative bacteria, and this treatment should be combined with other treatments (antiseptics and surgical treatment). Surface decontamination using chemical agents may be used as an adjuvant treatment; however, the definitive clinical benefit is yet not proven. Laser treatment may result in a short-term decrease in periodontal pocket depth, while air powder abrasive is effective in cleaning a previously contaminated implant surface. Surgical elimination of a pocket, bone recontouring and plaque control are also effective for treating peri-implantitis. The current evidence indicates that regenerative approaches to treat peri-implant defects are unpredictable.', 'Impact of design elements of the implant supracrestal complex (ISC) on the risk of peri-implant mucositis and peri-implantitis: A critical review  2021 The Authors. Clinical Oral Implants Research published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.Objective: The aim of this review was to investigate the evidence correlating the emergence profile (EP) and emergence angle (EA), peri-implant tissue height, implant neck design, abutment and/or prosthesis material, retention and connection types with risk of peri-implant mucositis and peri-implantitis. Methods: Seven focus questions were identified, and seven electronic search queries were conducted in PubMed. Human studies reporting on bleeding on probing, probing depth or case definitions of peri-implant mucositis and peri-implantitis were included. Results: Emerging evidence with bone-level implants suggests a link between EA combined with convex EP and peri-implantitis. Depth of the peri-implant sulcus of ≥3 mm is shown to be reducing the effectiveness of treatment of established peri-implant mucositis. Modification of the prosthesis contour is shown to be an effective supplement of the anti-infective treatment of peri-implant mucositis. Limited evidence points to no difference with regard to the risk for peri-implant mucositis between tissue- and bone-level implants, as well as the material of the abutment or the prosthesis. Limited evidence suggests the use or not of prosthetic abutments in external connections and does not change the risk for peri-implantitis. Literature with regard to prosthesis retention type and risk for peri-implantitis is inconclusive. Conclusions: Limited evidence indicates the involvement of EA, EP, sulcus depth and restricted accessibility to oral hygiene in the manifestation and/or management of peri-implant mucositis/peri-implantitis. Conclusions are limited by the lack of consensus definitions and validated outcomes measures, as well as diverse methodological approaches. Purpose-designed studies are required to clarify current observations.', 'Peri-implantitis: Summary and consensus statements of group 3. The 6th EAO Consensus Conference 2021  2021 The Authors.

A further aim was to evaluate peri-implant soft-tissue changes following surgical peri-implantitis treatment. Materials and methods: Group discussions based on two systematic reviews (SR) and one critical review (CR) addressed (i) the influence of implant material and surface characteristics on the incidence and progression of peri-implantitis, (ii) implant and restorative design elements and the associated risk for peri-implant diseases, and (iii) peri-implant soft-tissue level changes and patient-reported outcomes following peri-implantitis treatment. Consensus statements, clinical recommendations, and implications for future research were discussed within the group and approved during plenary sessions. Results: Data from preclinical in vivo studies demonstrated significantly greater radiographic bone loss and increased area of inflammatory infiltrate at modified compared to non-modified surface implants. Limited clinical data did not show differences between modified and non-modified implant surfaces in incidence or progression of peri-implantitis (SR). There is some evidence that restricted accessibility for oral hygiene and an emergence angle of >30 combined with a convex emergence profile of the abutment/prosthesis are associated with an increased risk for peri-implantitis (CR). Reconstructive therapy for peri-implantitis resulted in significantly less soft-tissue recession, when compared with access flap. Implantoplasty or the adjunctive use of a barrier membrane had no influence on the extent of peri-implant mucosal recession following peri-implantitis treatment (SR). Conclusions: Prosthesis overcontouring and impaired access to oral hygiene procedures increases risk for peri-implantitis. When indicated, reconstructive peri-implantitis treatment may facilitate the maintenance of post-operative peri-implant soft-tissue levels.']"

In conclusion, the results of the study demonstrated that adjuvant-KNPs are effective in eliciting immune responses against PRRSV and protecting against PRRSV infections over KNPs and inactivated PRRSV and can be used as an adjuvant for intranasal PRRSV vaccines.', 'Cell-mediated immune response and protective efficacy of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus modified-live vaccines against co-challenge with PRRSV-1 and PRRSV-2  2020, The Author(s).Cell-mediated immunity (CMI), IL-10, and the protective efficacy of modified-live porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) vaccines (MLV) against co-challenge with PRRSV-1 and PRRSV-2 (HP-PRRSV) were investigated. Seventy, PRRSV-free, 3-week old, pigs were allocated into 7 groups. Six groups were intramuscularly vaccinated with MLV, including Porcilis (PRRSV-1 MLV, MSD Animal Health, The Netherlands), Amervac (PRRSV-1 MLV, Laboratorios Hipra, Spain), Fostera (PRRSV-2 MLV, Zoetis, USA), Ingelvac PRRS MLV and Ingelvac PRRS ATP (PRRSV-2, Boehringer Ingelheim, USA), and Prime Pac PRRS (PRRSV-2 MLV, MSD Animal Health, The Netherlands). Unvaccinated pigs were left as control. Lymphocyte proliferative response, IL-10 and IFN-γ production were determined. At 35 days post-vaccination (DPV), all pigs were inoculated intranasally with 2 ml of each PRRSV-1 (105.4 TCID50/ml) and PRRSV-2 (105.2 TCID50/ml, HP-PRRSV). Following challenge, sera were quantitatively assayed for PRRSV RNA. Pigs were necropsied at 7 days post-challenge. Viremia, macro- and microscopic lung lesion together with PRRSV antigen presence were evaluated in lung tissues. The results demonstrated that, regardless of vaccine genotype, CMI induced by all MLVs was relatively slow. Increased production of IL-10 in all vaccinated groups was observed at 7 and 14 DPV. Pigs in Amervac, Ingelvac MLV and Ingelvac ATP groups had significantly higher levels of IL-10 compared to Porcilis, Fostera and Prime Pac groups at 7 and 14 DPV. Following challenge, regardless to vaccine genotype, vaccinated pigs had significantly lower lung lesion scores and PRRSV antigens than those in the control group. Both PRRSV-1 and PRRSV-2 RNA were significantly reduced. Prime Pac pigs had lowest PRRSV-1 and PRRSV-2 RNA in serum, and micro- and macroscopic lung lesion scores (p < 0.05) compared to other vaccinated groups. In conclusion, PRRSV MLVs, regardless of vaccine genotype, can reduce viremia and lung lesions following co-challenge with PRRSV-1 and PRRSV-2 (HP-PRRSV). The main difference between PRRSV MLV is the production of IL-10 following vaccination.', 'Efficacy of a type 2 PRRSV modified live vaccine (PrimePac™ PRRS) against a Thai HP-PRRSV challenge  2018, Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature.The Chinese highly pathogenic porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (HP-PRRSV) has caused a severe threat to the pig population in Southeast Asian countries. The purpose of this study was to investigate the efficacy of a type 2 PRRSV modified live vaccine (PrimePac™ PRRS, lineage 7) against a Thai HP-PRRSV (10PL01, lineage 8). Three-week-old PRRSV-free pigs were randomly assigned into three groups. Vaccinated challenged group (group 1, n = 16) was immunized with PrimePac™ PRRS vaccine at 3 weeks old. The unvaccinated challenged group (group 2, n = 16) was injected with PBS at 3 weeks old, and unvaccinated unchallenged group (group 3, n = 10) was served as a negative control. At 9 weeks old, all groups, except the negative control group, were challenged with the Thai HP-PRRSV. All pigs were monitored daily during 10 days post-infection (dpi) and were necropsied at 10 and 17 dpi. The results revealed that vaccinated challenged pigs showed significantly lower (p < 0.05) mean rectal temperatures, clinical respiratory scores, lung lesion scores, and levels of virus load in serum and lung tissue compared with the unvaccinated challenged pigs. Moreover, vaccinated challenged pigs exhibited PRRSV-specific serum neutralizing antibodies at the end of the experiment. Our findings indicated that the studied type 2 PRRSV vaccine provided partial protection against the Thai HP-PRRSV infection based on the body temperature, levels of viremia, and the severity of lung lesions. These results demonstrated that partial protection of PrimePac™ PRRS vaccine might be useful for controlling HP-PRRSV infection in the endemic area.']"

It has been reported that all humans generate unique VOC profiles in their exhaled breath which can be utilized as biomarkers to diagnose disease conditions. The VOCs available in exhaled human breath are the products of metabolic activity in the body and, therefore, any changes in its control level can be utilized to diagnose specific diseases. More than 1000 VOCs have been identified in exhaled human breath along with the respiratory droplets which provide rich information on overall health conditions. This provides great potential as a biomarker for a disease that can be sampled non-invasively from exhaled breath with breath biopsy. However, it is still a great challenge to develop a quick responsive, highly selective, and sensitive VOC-sensing system. The VOC sensors are usually coated with various sensing materials to achieve target-specific detection and real-time monitoring of the VOC molecules in the exhaled breath. These VOC-sensing materials have been the subject of huge interest and extensive research has been done in developing various sensing tools based on electrochemical, chemoresistive, and optical methods. The target-sensitive material with excellent sensing performance and capturing of the VOC molecules can be achieved by optimizing the materials, methods, and its thickness. This review paper extensively provides a detailed literature survey on various non-biological VOC-sensing materials including metal oxides, polymers, composites, and other novel materials. Furthermore, this review provides the associated limitations of each material and a summary table comparing the performance of various sensing materials to give a better insight to the readers.', 'Molecularly Imprinted Polymer-Based Optical Sensor for Isopropanol Vapor  2022 by the authors.Recent advances have allowed the monitoring of several volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in human exhaled breath, and many of them are being utilized as a biomarker to diagnose several diseases, including diabetes. Among several VOCs, isopropanol (IPA) has been reported as a common volatile compound in the exhaled breath of patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes. In this article, an experimental approach is discussed to develop a highly selective and sensitive IPA vapor sensor system. The fabricated sensor is comprised of a small and portable glass slide coated with molecularly imprinted polymer containing specific binding sites compatible with IPA molecules. The developed sensor is based on the wavelength interrogation technique. The fabricated device is analyzed for the detection of IPA vapor with different concentrations varying from 50% to 100%. The sensor exhibits maximum sensitivities of 0.37, 0.30, and 0.62 nm/%IPA, respectively, for 30, 60, and 90 min, respectively, and an excellent sensitivity of 0.63 nm/%IPA for 120 min exposure along with good selectivity among a similar class of VOCs. The major features of the sensor i.e., small size, portability, cost-effectiveness, high sensitivity, and good selectivity, make it a potential candidate for diabetes monitoring. The promising results of the sensor illustrate its potential in diabetes monitoring applications.', 'ZnO Nanorods Coated Single-Mode–Multimode–Single-Mode Optical Fiber Sensor for VOC Biomarker Detection  2022 by the authors.This work demonstrated a ZnO-coated optical fiber sensor for the detection of a volatile organic compound (VOC) biomarker for diabetes for detecting isopropanol (IPA) markers. A coreless silica fiber (CSF) was connected to a single-mode fiber (SMF) at both ends to achieve a SMF–CSF–SMF structure. CSF is the sensing region where multimode interference (MMI) generates higher light interaction at the interface between the fiber and sensing medium, leading to enhanced sensitivity. Optimization of the CSF length was conducted numerically to attain the highest possible coupling efficiency at the output. Surface functionalization was achieved via hydrothermal growth of ZnO nanorods directly onto the CSF at low temperatures. The optical fiber-based sensor was successfully fabricated and tested with 20%, 40%, 60%, 80%, and 100% of IPA. The sensor response was recorded using an optical spectrometer and analyzed for sensor sensitivity. The fabricated sensor shows the potential to detect isopropanol with the sensitivity of 0.053 nm/%IPA vapor. Further improvement of the sensor sensitivity and selectivity is also proposed for future work.']"

In this paper, the carrier-based dipolar modulation and general solution of modulation matrix are used to generate the PWM signals which encompass all well-known PWM with 6 BSOs. The research results reveal that a unified PWM strategy can be done. The space-vector modulation, which is a complex and intensive calculation can be realized easily using the proposed PWM method.', 'Carrier-Based Overmodulation Strategy for Matrix Converters  2018 IEEJ Industry Application Society.In this paper, carrier-based overmodulation for matrix converters is proposed. From the viewpoint of carrier-based modulation, there are two cases of overmodulation which correspond to (1) over output-voltage range and (2) over input-current range. Three simple strategies to limit the modulating functions under overmodulation are then studied. It is also clarified how the switching patterns and space vector utilization change in the overmodulation range. And the effects of the switching patterns and space-vector utilization on the current and voltage distortions are compared. Finally, the simulation results reveal that the error of fundamental amplitude between the output voltage and the desired output voltage is small with the so-called <2u1d>PWM, while using the max-input-phase as the reference in the carrier-based modulation gives low output voltage distortion.', 'Double-Carrier-Based PWM Theory for Independent Power Control of Dual-Input Three-level Inverters  2022 IEEJ-IAS.In this paper, double-carrier-based PWM theory for direct and independent power control for dual-input three-level inverters is proposed. With the proposed PWM strategy, the upper and lower dc bus voltages can be controlled separately in a decoupled manner. These characteristics are crucial in photovoltaic applications (PV) when tracking of maximum power points for two strings of PV panels under different irradiations is required. Independent control of input dc-bus power is achieved by simply decomposing the voltage command of the inverter in proportional to the required dc-bus power. Implementation of the proposed PWM strategy is also simple because it uses double carrier waveforms supported by PWM modules in most hardware. Effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed PWM theory are verified by experiment.']"

The aim of this study was to investigate the safety and pharmacokinetic profiles of a newly developed, standardized extract of Centella asiatica (ECa 233) capsule in healthy Thai volunteers. This study was designed as an open-labeled, 2-se-quence dosage, single- and repeated-dose study investigated under fasting conditions. Plasma concentrations of the parent compounds and their relative acid metabolites were measured and pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated using noncompartmental analysis. Tolerability was assessed based on physical examinations, monitoring of vital signs, clinical laboratory tests, and any observed adverse events. A key finding of this study was that the pharmacokinetics of ECa 233 in healthy volunteers did not correspond with its pharmacokinetics in animal studies. As indicated in human pharmacokinetic parameters, maximum plasma concentration and area under the curve of the parent compounds (madecassoside and asiaticoside) were very low, while their respective metabolites (madecassic acid and asiatic acid) demonstrated higher values. Based on the pharmacokinetic results observed in the dose comparison, accumulation of active metabolites after repeated dose is highly suggestive. In addition, the asiatic acid profile showed 2-fold increase in C max and AUC (0 – t) after increasing dose from 250 to 500 mg of ECa 233. Lastly, the safety and tolerability evaluation illustrated that single and multiple doses in both 250 and 500 mg oral administration of ECa 233 were well tolerated, and none of the volunteers discontinued their participation due to adverse effects during the study.', 'Immunomodulatory effect of standardized C. asiatica extract on a promotion of regulatory T cells in rats  2021, The Author(s).Background: ECa 233 is a standardized extract of C. asiatica containing the triterpenoid glycosides, madecassoside to asiaticoside in the ratio of (1.5 ± 0.5):1. Anti-inflammatory activities of ECa 233 have been reported; however the immunomodulatory effects of ECa 233 on regulatory T cells, which have a pivotal role in immune regulation, has not been elucidated. Therefore, we investigated the effects of ECa 233 on regulatory T cells that may provide benefits in autoimmune and chronic inflammatory diseases. Methods: ECa 233 was prepared as oral suspension in 0.5% carboxymethylcellulose and administered to male Wistar rats via oral gavage. The pharmacokinetics and toxicity of ECa 233 were evaluated. Splenic lymphocytes were isolated and analyzed by flow cytometry and qPCR to determine the immunomodulatory effects of ECa 233 on regulatory T cells. Results: All rats had good tolerability to ECa 233 and other test preparations. The pharmacokinetic study showed low oral bioavailability for both triterpenoids, with the maximum plasma concentration reached at 4 h for asiaticoside and at 0.5 h for madecassoside. Multiple oral administration of ECa 233 reduced the frequency of T cells, particularly CD8 T cells in rats. ECa 233 enhanced the percentage of regulatory T cells, characterized by high expression of CD25+ and upregulation of FoxP3 gene. Conclusions: The present study demonstrated that ECa 233 possesses immunosuppressive properties by enhancing regulatory T cells. These results provide in vivo evidence for the anti-inflammatory action of ECa 233, in line with previously reports, and the potential uses of ECa 233 in the treatment of chronic inflammatory and autoimmune diseases.', 'Pharmacokinetics and metabolomics investigation of an orally modified formula of standardized Centella asiatica extract in healthy volunteers  2021, The Author(s).The formula of a standardized extract of Centella asiatica (ECa 233) was modified to improve its dissolution, with implications for pharmacokinetics and metabolomic profile. This study aimed to understand the resultant changes in disposition kinetics of ECa 233 and alterations to human metabolome after oral administration. This study was a two-sequence of dosages (250 and 500 mg), with an open-label phase I clinical trial. The modified formula was administered in single and multiple doses to twelve healthy Thai volunteers. The major parent compounds, madecassoside and asiaticoside, were rarely absorbed, instead undergoing biotransformation into active metabolites, madecassic acid and asiatic acid with possibility to be eliminated via fecal route. Increasing the dose of ECa 233 resulted in significantly greater plasma levels of those active metabolites, with accumulation of asiatic acid after multiple oral administration for seven days. Examining the impacts of accumulation behavior on metabolomics, the study traced changes in levels pre- and post-dose of five relevant human metabolites. Administration of ECa 233 was found to be significantly associated with an increase of choline, an endogenous metabolite with documented benefits for learning and memory. Therefore, ECa 233 may be useful in mitigating cognitive impairment, through its role in modulating human metabolites.']"

Most of the commercially available antibiotics are ineffective owing to the development of drug resistance and adverse side effects. The drug or multidrug resistance results in higher dose administration of antimicrobial drugs, which may lead to severe toxicity to the surrounding cells. Therefore, the development of newer drugs is a necessity to combat such issues and also control the infection against pathogens. In this context, nanomaterials are emerging tools for controlling infections without development of any resistance. Several metal and metal oxide-based nanomaterials have been used as antimicrobial agents that efficiently control the infection against pathogens. Moreover, various nanocarriers have also been used for the delivery of antibiotics to improve their effectiveness against pathogens. Additionally, combined therapy, such as nanomaterials with commercially available antimicrobial drugs, are also used for treating infectious diseases, showing synergetic effects on controlling the infections. These nanomaterials have advantages over commercially available antibiotics such as cost-effectiveness, safety, prolonged effectiveness, and no development of resistance. The mode of action of these nanomaterials is mainly the generation of reactive oxygen species, disruption of cellular membrane, inhibition of enzymes, and synthesis of DNA. Despite the tremendous success of nanomaterials in infection control, long-term exposure-related toxicity remains a concern. Usually, extensive use of nanomaterials may cause adverse effects, as nanomaterials release ions into the environment, which kills some beneficial micro-organisms.

However, at present nano-engineering techniques has been employed in the crop fields and gaining more and more consideration, but plant-nanomaterial interaction is still in early stages of study. Apart from this, the fortune and transformation of the nanomaterials within plants system is still the subject of consideration. As a result, many investigations have been carried out concerning nanomaterials and their applications in diverse fields together with nano-agricultural products like nano-fertilizers, nano-herbicides, and nano-pesticides.

This study examined gene expression during early phase of cellular reprogramming in the relationship to the iPSC colony morphology and in vitro pluripotent characteristics. Fibroblasts were reprogrammed with OCT4, SOX2, KLF4 and c-MYC. Two different colony morphologies referred to either compact (n = 10) or loose (n = 10) colonies were further examined for proliferative activity, gene expression and in vitro pluripotency. A total of 1,697 iPSC-like colonies (2.34%) were observed after gene transduction. The compact colonies contained with tightly packed cells with a distinct-clear border between the colony and feeder cells, while loose colonies demonstrated irregular colony boundary. For quantitative expression of genes responsible for early phase cell reprogramming, the Dppa2 and EpCAM were significantly upregulated while NR0B1 was downregulated in compact colonies compared with loose phenotype (p <.05). Higher proportion of compact iPSC phenotype (5 of 10, 50%) could be maintained in undifferentiated state for more than 50 passages compared unfavourably with loose morphology (3 of 10, 30%). All iPS cell lines obtained from these two types of colony morphologies expressed pluripotent genes and proteins (OCT4, NANOG and E-cadherin). In addition, they could aggregate and form three-dimensional structure of embryoid bodies. However, only compact iPSC colonies differentiated into three germ layers. Molecular signature of early phase of cell reprogramming coupled with primary colony morphology reflected the in vitro pluripotency of porcine iPSCs. These findings can be simply applied for pre-screening selection of the porcine iPSC cell line.', 'Rabbit induced pluripotent stem cells retain capability of in vitro cardiac differentiation  2019 Japanese Association for Laboratory Animal Science.Stem cells are promising cell source for treatment of multiple diseases as well as myocardial infarction. Rabbit model has essentially used for cardiovascular diseases and regeneration but information on establishment of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and differentiation potential is fairly limited. In addition, there is no report of cardiac differentiation from iPSCs in the rabbit model. In this study, we generated rabbit iPSCs by reprogramming rabbit fibroblasts using the 4 transcription factors (OCT3/4, SOX2, KLF4, and c-Myc). Three iPSC lines were established. The iPSCs from all cell lines expressed genes (OCT3/4, SOX2, KLF4 and NANOG) and proteins (alkaline phosphatase, OCT-3/4 and SSEA-4) essentially described for pluripotency (in vivo and in vitro differentiation). Furthermore, they also had ability to form embryoid body (EB) resulting in three-germ layer differentiation. However, ability of particular cell lines and cell numbers at seeding markedly influenced on EB formation and also their diameters. The cell density at 20,000 cells per EB was selected for cardiac differentiation. After plating, the EBs attached and cardiac-like beating areas were seen as soon as 11 days of culture. The differentiated cells expressed cardiac progenitor marker FLK1 (51 ± 1.48%) on day 5 and cardiac troponin-T protein (10.29 ± 1.37%) on day 14. Other cardiac marker genes (cardiac ryanodine receptors (RYR2), α-actinin and PECAM1) were also expressed.

Porcine-induced pluripotent stem cells (piPSCs) are traditionally established using four transcription factors (4TF): OCT4, SOX2, KLF4, and C-MYC. However, the inefficiencies in the reprogramming of piPSCs and the maintenance of their self-renewal and pluripotency remain challenges to be resolved. LIN28 was demonstrated to play a vital role in the induction of pluripotency in humans. To investigate whether this factor is similarly required by piPSCs, the effects of adding LIN28 to the 4TF induction method (5F approach) on the efficiency of piPSC reprogramming and maintenance of self-renewal and pluripotency were examined. Using a retroviral vector, porcine fetal fibroblasts were transfected with human OCT4, SOX2, KLF4, and C-MYC with or without LIN28. The colony morphology and chromosomal stability of these piPSC lines were examined and their pluripotency properties were characterized by investigating both their expression of pluripotency-associated genes and proteins and in vitro and in vivo differentiation capabilities. Alkaline phosphatase assay revealed the reprogramming efficiencies to be 0.33 and 0.17% for the 4TF and 5TF approaches, respectively, but the maintenance of self-renewal and pluripotency until passage 40 was 6.67 and 100%, respectively. Most of the 4TF-piPSC colonies were flat in shape, showed weak positivity for alkaline phosphatase, and expressed a significantly high level of SSEA-4 protein, except for one cell line (VSMUi001-A) whose properties were similar to those of the 5TF-piPSCs; that is, tightly packed and dome-like in shape, markedly positive for alkaline phosphatase, and expressing endogenous pluripotency genes (pOCT4, pSOX2, pNANOG, and pLIN28), significantly high levels of pluripotent proteins (OCT4, SOX2, NANOG, LIN28, and SSEA-1), and a significantly low level of SSEA-4 protein. VSMUi001-A and all 5F-piPSC lines formed embryoid bodies, underwent spontaneous cardiogenic differentiation with cardiac beating, expressed cardiomyocyte markers, and developed teratomas. In conclusion, in addition to the 4TF, LIN28 is required for the effective induction of piPSCs and the maintenance of their long-term self-renewal and pluripotency toward the development of all germ layers. These piPSCs have the potential applicability for veterinary science.']"

In addition to antigen test kit (ATK) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR), CRISPR-based assays for detection of SARS-CoV-2 have gained attention because it has a simple setup but still maintain high specificity and sensitivity. However, the SARS-CoV-2 has been continuing mutating over the past few years. Thus, molecular tools that rely on matching at the nucleotide level need to be reevaluated to preserve their specificity and sensitivity. Here, we analyzed how mutations in different variants of concern (VOC), including Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta, and Omicron strains, could introduce mismatches to the previously reported primers and crRNAs used in the CRISPR-Cas system. Over 40% of the primer sets and 15% of the crRNAs contain mismatches. Hence, primers and crRNAs in nucleic acid-based assays must be chosen carefully to pair up with SARS-CoV-2 variants.

Several studies developed SARS-CoV-2 detection based on CRISPR-Cas12a platform; however, the validations with RNA extracted from clinical specimens were limited. Therefore, this study evaluated the clinical performance of previously described CRISPR-Cas12a based diagnostic assays for SARS-CoV-2. According to the results, the CRISPR-Cas12a assays on N1 and S genes provided diagnostic accuracy (≥ 95 %) comparable to the qRT-PCR results. The assays with E, N2 and S genes yielded acceptable sensitivity of detection (≥ 95 %) whereas N1 and S genes provided outstanding specificity of detection (100 %). Preferably, multiple target genes should be detected by using CRISPR-Cas12a to ensure the most effective SARS-CoV-2 detection.

The absolute i.m. bioavailability was 82.65% and the binding percentage of ENR to plasma protein ranged from 9% to 18% with an average of 10.6%. Percentage of CIP (plasma concentrations) was 15.9% and 19.9% after i.v. and i.m. administration, respectively. Based on the pharmacokinetic data, susceptibility break point and PK-PD indexes, i.m. single administration of ENR at a dosage of 5 mg/kg b.w. might be appropriate for treatment of susceptible bacteria (MIC > 1 μg/mL) in freshwater crocodiles, C. siamensis.', 'Pharmacokinetics of ceftriaxone in freshwater crocodiles (Crocodylus siamensis) after intramuscular administration at two dosages  2019 John Wiley & Sons LtdOne of the major obstacles to the successful treatment of infectious disease in freshwater crocodile species is incorrect dosing of antibiotics. There are few reports on pharmacokinetics and dosage regimens of antimicrobial drugs in crocodiles. The purpose of the present study was to clarify the pharmacokinetic characteristics of ceftriaxone (CEF) in Siamese freshwater crocodiles (Crocodylus siamensis). Freshwater crocodiles, Crocodylus siamensis, in breeding farms were treated with a single intramuscular administration of CEF at two dosages, 12.5 and 25 mg/kg body weight (b.w.). Blood samples were collected at preassigned times up to 168 hr. The plasma concentrations of CEF were measured by a validated method through liquid chromatography tandem-mass spectrometry. CEF plasma concentrations were quantified up to 72 and 96 hr after low- and high-dose administration, respectively. The Cmax values of CEF were 24.61 ± 5.15 µg/ml and 26.39 ± 2.81 µg/ml at dosages of 12.5 and 25 mg/kg b.w., respectively. The AUClast values increased in a dose-dependent fashion. The half-life values were not statistically different between the groups (around 20 hr). The average binding percentage of CEF to plasma protein was 53.78 ± 2.11%. Based on the pharmacokinetic data, susceptibility break-point and the surrogate PK-PD index (T > MIC, 0.2 μg/ml), i.m. administration of CEF at a dose of 12.5 mg/kg b.w. might be appropriate for initiating treatment of susceptible bacterial infections in freshwater crocodiles.', 'Pharmacokinetics of a long-acting formulation of oxytetracycline in freshwater crocodiles (Crocodylus siamensis) after intramuscular administration at three different dosages  2020 by the authors.

Therefore, this study was conducted to evaluate the pharmacokinetic profile of the oxytetracycline long-acting formulation (OTC-LA) in the freshwater crocodile, Crocodylus siamensis, following a single intramuscular (i.m.) administration at three different dosages of 5, 10 and 20 mg/kg body weight (b.w.). Blood samples were collected at assigned times up to 216 h after i.m. administration at the three different dosages. The plasma concentrations of OTC were measured using a validated liquid chromatography tandem-mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method. The Cmax (± SD) values of OTC were 2.15 ± 0.51 µg/mL, 7.68 ± 1.08 µg/mL and 17.08 ± 2.09 µg/mL at doses of 5, 10 and 20 mg/kg b.w., respectively. The elimination half-life values were 33.59 ± 2.51 h, 38.42 ± 5.47 h and 38.04 ± 1.98 h at dosages of 5, 10 and 20 mg/kg b.w., respectively. Based on the pharmacokinetic data, the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) index, the susceptibility break-point and plasma protein binding, a dosage once every two weeks of 10 mg/kg b.w. OTC intramuscularly might be suitable for initiating the treatment of susceptible bacterial infections in freshwater crocodiles. However, further PK/PD studies are warranted to confirm whether the dose rates used in this study can produce longer-term antimicrobial success for diseases caused by susceptible bacteria in freshwater crocodiles.']"

Published under exclusive license by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.Humancytosolic serine hydroxymethyltransferase (hcSHMT) is a promising target for anticancer chemotherapy and contains a flexible ""flap motif"" whose function is yet unknown. Here, using size-exclusion chromatography, analytical ultracentrifugation, small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, and ligand-binding and enzyme-kinetic analyses, we studied the functional roles of the flap motif by comparing WT hcSHMT with a flap-deleted variant (hcSHMT/Δflap). We found that deletion of the flap results in a mixture of apo-dimers and holo-tetramers, whereas the WT was mostly in the tetrameric form. MD simulations indicated that the flap stabilizes structural compactness and thereby enhances oligomerization. The hcSHMT/Δflap variant exhibited different catalytic properties in (6S)-tetrahydrofolate (THF)-dependent reactions compared with theWTbut had similar activity in THF-independent aldol cleavage of β-hydroxyamino acid. hcSHMT/Δflap was less sensitive to THF inhibition than theWT(Ki of 0.65 and 0.27mM THF at pH 7.5, respectively), and the THF dissociation constant of the WT was also 3-fold lower than that of hcSHMT/Δflap, indicating that the flap is important for THF binding. hcSHMT/ Δflap did not display the burst kinetics observed in the WT. These results indicate that, upon removal of the flap, product release is no longer the rate-limiting step, implying that the flap is important for controlling product release. The findings reported here improve our understanding of the functional roles of the flap motif in hcSHMT and provide fundamental insight into how a flexible loop can be involved in controlling the enzymatic reactions of hcSHMT and other enzymes.', 'Mangiferin is a new potential antimalarial and anticancer drug for targeting serine hydroxymethyltransferase Copyright  2023 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.Mangiferin, a polyphenolic xanthone glycoside found in various botanical sources, including mango (Mangifera indica L.) leaves, can exhibit a variety of bioactivities. Although mangiferin has been reported to inhibit many targets, none of the studies have investigated the inhibition of serine hydroxymethyltransferase (SHMT), an attractive target for antimalarial and anticancer drugs. SHMT, one of the key enzymes in the deoxythymidylate synthesis cycle, catalyzes the reversible conversion of l-serine and (6S)-tetrahydrofolate (THF) into glycine and 5,10-methylene THF. Here, in vitro and in silico studies were used to probe how mangiferin isolated from mango leaves inhibits Plasmodium falciparum and human cytosolic SHMTs. The inhibition kinetics at pH 7.5 revealed that mangiferin is a competitive inhibitor against THF for enzymes from both organisms. Molecular docking and molecular dynamic (MD) simulations demonstrated the inhibitory effects of the deprotonated forms of mangiferin, specifically the C6-O- species and its resonance C9-O- species appearing at pH 7.5, combined with two docked poses, either a xanthone or glucose moiety, placed inside the THF-binding pocket. The MD analysis revealed that both C6-O- and its resonance-stabilized C9-O- species can favorably bind to SHMT in a similar fashion to THF, supporting the THF competitive inhibition of mangiferin. In addition, characterization of the proton dissociation equilibria of isolated mangiferin revealed that only three hydroxy groups of the xanthone moiety, C6-OH, C3-OH, and C7-OH, underwent varying degrees of deprotonation with pKa values of 6.38 ± 0.11, 8.21 ± 0.35, and 12.37 ± 0.30, respectively, while C1-OH remained protonated. Altogether, our findings demonstrate a new bioactivity of mangiferin and provide the basis for the future development of mangiferin as a potent antimalarial and anticancer drug.', 'TOWARDS COMBATING ANTIBIOTIC RESISTANCE BY EXPLORING THE QUANTITATIVE STRUCTURE-ACTIVITY RELATIONSHIP OF NDM-1 INHIBITORS  2022, Leibniz Research Centre for Working Environment and Human Factors.

Its capability of horizontal transfer through plasmids, amongst humans, animal reservoirs and the environment, has added up to the totality of antimicrobial resistance control, animal husbandry and food safety. Thus far, there have been no effective drugs for neutralizing NDM-1. This study explores the structure-activity relationship of NDM-1 inhibitors. IC50 values of NDM-1 inhibitors were compiled from both the ChEMBL database and literature. After curation, a final set of 686 inhibitors were used for machine learning model building using the random forest algorithm against 12 sets of molecular fingerprints. Benchmark results indicated that the KlekotaRothCount fingerprint provided the best overall performance with an accuracy of 0.978 and 0.778 for the training and testing set, respectively.

We hypothesized that changes in MAP after treatment could validate it as a response biomarker. We prospectively collected serum samples and clinical stages of acute GVHD from 615 patients receiving hematopoietic cell transplantation in 20 centers at initiation of first-line systemic treatment and 4 weeks later. We computed MAPs and clinical responses and compared their abilities to predict 6-month nonrelapse mortality (NRM) in the validation cohort (n = 367). After 4 weeks of treatment, MAPs predicted NRM better than the change in clinical symptoms in all patients and identified 2 groups with significantly different NRM in both clinical responders (40% vs 12%, P < .0001) and nonresponders (65% vs 25%, P < .0001). MAPs successfully reclassified patients for NRM risk within every clinical grade of acute GVHD after 4 weeks of treatment. At the beginning of treatment, patients with a low MAP that rose above the threshold of 0.290 after 4 weeks of treatment had a significant increase in NRM, whereas patients with a high MAP at onset that fell below that threshold after treatment had a striking decrease in NRM that translated into clear differences in overall survival. We conclude that a MAP measured before and after treatment of acute GVHD is a response biomarker that predicts long-term outcomes more accurately than change in clinical symptoms. MAPs have the potential to guide therapy for acute GVHD and may function as a useful end point in clinical trials.', 'Evaluation of Elafin as a Prognostic Biomarker in Acute Graft-versus-Host Disease: M. G. Zewde et al  2021 The American Society for Transplantation and Cellular TherapyAcute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) is a major cause of mortality in patients undergoing hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) for hematologic malignancies. The skin is the most commonly involved organ in GVHD. Elafin, a protease inhibitor overexpressed in inflamed epidermis, was previously identified as a diagnostic biomarker of skin GVHD; however, this finding was restricted to a subset of patients with isolated skin GVHD. The main driver of nonrelapse mortality (NRM) in HCT recipients is gastrointestinal (GI) GVHD. Two biomarkers, Regenerating islet-derived 3a (REG3α) and Suppressor of tumorigenesis 2 (ST2), have been validated as biomarkers of GI GVHD that predict long-term outcomes in patients treated for GVHD. We undertook this study to determine the utility of elafin as a prognostic biomarker in the general population of acute GVHD patients in whom GVHD may develop in multiple organs. We analyzed serum elafin concentrations as a predictive biomarker of acute GVHD outcomes and compared it with ST2 and REG3α in a large group of patients treated at multiple centers. A total of 526 patients from the Mount Sinai Acute GVHD International Consortium (MAGIC) who had received corticosteroid treatment for skin GVHD and who had not been previously studied were analyzed. Serum concentrations of elafin, ST2, and REG3α were measured by ELISA in all patients. The patients were divided at random into equal training and validation sets, and a competing-risk regression model was developed to model 6-month NRM using elafin concentration in the training set. Additional models were developed using concentrations of ST2 and REG3α or the combination of all 3 biomarkers as predictors. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were constructed using the validation set to evaluate the predictive accuracy of each model and to stratify patients into high- and low-risk biomarker groups. The cumulative incidence of 6-month NRM, overall survival (OS), and 4-week treatment response were compared between the risk groups. Unexpectedly, patients in the low-risk elafin group demonstrated a higher incidence of 6-month NRM, although the difference was not statistically significant (17% versus 11%; P = .19). OS at 6 months (68% versus 68%; P > .99) and 4-week response (78% versus 78%; P = .98) were similar in the low-risk and high-risk elafin groups. The area under the ROC curve (AUC) was 0.55 for elafin and 0.75 for the combination of ST2 and REG3α. The addition of elafin to the other 2 biomarkers did not improve the AUC. Our data indicate that serum elafin concentrations measured at the initiation of systemic treatment for acute GVHD did not predict 6-month NRM, OS, or treatment response in a multicenter population of patients treated systemically for acute GVHD. As seen in previous studies, serum concentrations of the GI GVHD biomarkers ST2 and REG3α were significant predictors of NRM, and the addition of elafin levels did not improve their accuracy. These results underscore the importance of GI disease in driving NRM in patients who develop acute GVHD.', 'Incidence, clinical presentation, risk factors, outcomes, and biomarkers in de novo late acute GVHD  2023 by The American Society of Hematology.Late acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) is defined as de novo acute GVHD presenting beyond 100 days after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) without manifestations of chronic GVHD. Data are limited regarding its characteristics, clinical course, and risk factors because of underrecognition and changes in classification. We evaluated 3542 consecutive adult recipients of first HCTs at 24 Mount Sinai Acute GVHD International Consortium (MAGIC) centers between January 2014 and August 2021 to better describe the clinical evolution and outcomes of late acute GVHD. The cumulative incidence of classic acute GVHD that required systemic treatment was 35.2%, and an additional 5.7% of patients required treatment for late acute GVHD. At the onset of symptoms, late acute GVHD was more severe than classic acute GVHD based on both clinical and MAGIC algorithm probability biomarker parameters and showed a lower overall response rate on day 28. Both clinical and biomarker grading at the time of treatment stratified the risk of nonrelapse mortality (NRM) in patients with classic and late acute GVHD, respectively, but long-term NRM and overall survival did not differ between patients with classic and late acute GVHD. Advanced age, female-to-male sex mismatch, and the use of reduced intensity conditioning were associated with the development of late acute GVHD, whereas the use of posttransplant cyclophosphamide–based GVHD prevention was protective mainly because of shifts in GVHD timing. Because overall outcomes were comparable, our findings, although not definitive, suggest that similar treatment strategies, including eligibility for clinical trials, based solely on clinical presentation at onset are appropriate.']"

The RETAC jig could be used to separate plastics heavier than water (specific gravity (SG) > 1.0) with different SGs while the hybrid jig—a process combining jig and flotation—was developed to separate plastics with similar SGs but different surface wettabilities. Meanwhile the reverse jig—a RETAC jig with a top screen—is used to separate plastics lighter than water with different SGs. In this study, a novel method that combines the principle of reverse and hybrid jigs, called “reverse hybrid jig separation” was developed to separate plastics lighter than water having similar SGs but different surface wettabilities. The tests were carried out with wastes from an eco-cable wire recycling facility in Japan, which is composed of polyethylene (PE) and cross-linked polyethylene (XLPE). The reverse hybrid jig separation results showed that bubble attachment to and detachment from plastic particles strongly influenced the separation efficiency. In addition, the effects of particle size on separation efficiency were also evaluated.', 'Estimation of hybrid jig separation efficiency using a modified concentration criterion based on apparent densities of plastic particles with attached bubbles  2020, Springer Japan KK, part of Springer Nature.The hybrid jig, which combines the principles of jig separation and flotation, was recently developed to separate mixed-plastics with similar specific gravities (SG) effectively. In this type of jig, air bubbles are introduced during water pulsation to modify the apparent SG (SGapparent) of plastics by the attachment of air bubbles to the particles so that the hybrid jig can separate materials having identical SGs if their surface wettabilities are different. Because the change in SGapparent—determined by the volume of attached bubbles on the particle surface—is critical for efficient separation in hybrid jigs, a method to estimate this parameter should be developed. In this study, a laser-assisted measurement apparatus was developed to quantify the attached-bubble volume on plastics during water pulsation. Hybrid jig separation was also conducted using three mixtures containing plastics of almost identical SGs: (i) polyvinyl chloride (PVC)/polyethylene terephthalate (PET), (ii) polypropylene with glass fiber (PPGF)/high-impact polystyrene (HIPS), and (iii) cross-linked polyethylene (XLPE)/polyethylene (PE). Finally, to estimate the separation efficiency of hybrid jig, a new index called the apparent concentration criterion (CCapparent) is proposed. The results showed that SGapparent and CCapparent calculated using the proposed methods could be used to estimate the hybrid jig separation efficiency.', 'Development of Microencapsulation-Hybrid Jig Separation Technique as a Clean Coal Technology  2023 by the authors.In this study, the microencapsulation-hybrid jig separation technique was developed to improve the separation efficiency of pyrite and coal in the particle size range of 1–4 mm where conventional jig separation becomes inefficient. A hybrid jig is a gravity concentrator combining the concepts of jig separation and flotation to stratify particles based on their apparent specific gravity. Meanwhile, microencapsulation—a technique that encapsulates target materials with a protective coating—was applied to render pyrite hydrophilic and improve its separation from hydrophobic coal. The results showed that the required time for separation in the hybrid jig (0.5 min) was shorter than in conventional jig (2 min). Moreover, the effects of particle size on separation efficiency were reduced when a hybrid jig is used. However, the separation efficiency of hybrid jig separation was lower than that of the conventional jig because attachment of bubbles occurred to both pyrite and coal, which are hydrophobic. Using the microencapsulation-hybrid jig separation technique, the separation of coal and pyrite was significantly improved (~100%) because of the formation of hydrophilic iron phosphate coatings on pyrite that limited bubble attachment. This means that microencapsulation-hybrid jig separation is a promising clean coal technology that not only enhances the separation efficiency of the hybrid jig but also passivates pyrite and limits AMD formation in the tailings/rejects.']"

Estimated cost from food-borne illnesses is USD 110 billion per year, which is an economic burden to low- and middle-income countries. Thailand is a leading producer and consumer of seafood, but little is known about bacterial contamination in seafood. In particular, public health agencies need to know the relationship between Salmonella contamination in seafood and risk factors, as assessed with readily available culture-dependent and bacterial phenotyping methods. To address this, levels of indicator bacteria, Salmonella and Vibrio in various seafood products were determined to identify risk factors associated with Salmonella contamination. A total of 335 samples were collected from October 2018 to July 2019 at seafood markets throughout Bangkok, Thailand; overall sample composition was Pacific white shrimp (n = 85), oysters (n = 82), blood cockles (n = 84), and Asian seabass (n = 84).

KGaA, WeinheimZ-isomers of lycopene exhibit higher bioavailability and antioxidant capacity than those of the all-E-isomer. Therefore, it is important to develop an efficient and environmentally friendly procedure for Z-isomerization. The current methods for Z-isomerization of (all-E)-lycopene use toxic chemicals such as organic solvents and catalysts. This study is aimed to develop a chemical-free method for Z-isomerization of (all-E)-lycopene in tomato powder by hot air and superheated steam heating. The Z-isomerization reaction is promoted by heating above the melting point of lycopene. When heated with superheated steam, the thermal decomposition of lycopene is suppressed compared to that when heated with hot air. When tomato powder is heated at 240 °C for 5 min by superheated steam, the total Z-isomer content and remaining lycopene are 69.0% and 90.7%, respectively, while with hot air heating, the total Z-isomer content and remaining lycopene are 69.9% and 68.0%, respectively. These results indicate that the thermal Z-isomerization of lycopene occurs in the molten state and heating in a low oxygen atmosphere suppresses the thermal decomposition of lycopene. Practical Applications: Tomato powder rich in lycopene Z-isomers is an important ingredient for the food and animal feed industries. Since Z-isomers of lycopene are more soluble in solvents including ethanol which is a low-toxicity and environmentally friendly solvent, the efficiency of lycopene extraction with ethanol can be improved by using the Z-isomer-rich tomato powder as a raw material. The obtained Z-isomer-rich extract has a high added value because the Z-isomers have higher bioavailability and antioxidant capacity than those of the all-E-isomer.

As a primary step to recover γ-oryzanol from RBAO, glycerides must be removed by conversion into more easily separable components such as FFAs. In this study, enzymatic hydrolysis was proposed as a green alternative to conventional base-catalyzed hydrolysis for glyceride removal from RBAO. The face-centered central composite rotatable design was used to investigate the effects of three independent variables: time, temperature, and water:RBAO ratio, and their interactions on the responses: glyceride removal, γ-oryzanol loss, and FFA production, and to determine the statistical models describing their relationships. In addition, by applying the desirability function approach, the optimal location was identified, corresponding to maximal glyceride removal with an imposed upper limit of 35% γ-oryzanol loss. At an established optimal condition of 22 h, 48.5 °C and 1:1 water:RBAO ratio, the experiments in which the enzymatic hydrolysis was carried out at 1x and 10x reaction scales confirmed the validity of the models: glyceride removal approached completion (99%), γ-oryzanol loss was as low as 32%, and the FFA production was 73–75%, falling within the 95% prediction interval. The results of this study demonstrated that the enzymatic hydrolysis is a promising method for glyceride removal prior to recovery of γ-oryzanol from RBAO, and that the statistical models gave accurate predictions of responses and would be useful further industrial design of the process.', 'Enzymatic esterification/transesterification of rice bran acid oil for subsequent γ-oryzanol recovery  2023 BRTeam.

Herein, we determine the effects of varying reaction conditions, i.e., ethanol:RBAO molar ratio, temperature, reaction time, enzyme loading, and agitation speed, on the degrees of glyceride removal, γ-oryzanol loss, free fatty acid (FFA) remaining, and biodiesel content. Up to 100% glyceride removal was achieved with a relatively high biodiesel yield (84%) and γ-oryzanol loss as low as 26% under our most suitable reaction conditions (5:1 ethanol:RBAO molar ratio, 40 °C, 24 h reaction time, 10%wt enzyme loading, 200 rpm agitation). Furthermore, of the remaining oryzanol, up to 94% was recovered by the acid-base extraction with 2-4 M ethanolic NaOH solution. Our results suggest that a combination of enzymatic esterification/transesterification with subsequent acid-base extraction offers an efficient alternative approach to the simultaneous production of biodiesel and γ-oryzanol recovery from low-cost RBAO. Based on our analysis of techno-economic and environmental sustainability, integration of the present method into a rice bran oil refinery would make the process profitable, with the minimum use of toxic chemicals and energy.']"

In particular, the 3D aspect that makes the 3D color systems different from standard 2D printing, such as ink and substrate characteristics, viewing conditions, and base materials. Therefore, to the best of our knowledge, there is no suitable established method that supports color reproduction for inkjet FDM color 3D printing. In this paper, we analyze the color profile of an inkjet FDM color 3D printer to obtain a color model that could bridge the gap between a digital design (as an input) and the actual 3D printed results (as an output). We then created the color model by reproducing each color mapped to every possible color pair to determine the closest color between the target and printing colors on the basis of the color difference value, which can be rendered in lieu of the original printing colors. We verify our proposed color model by printing the mapped color and conduct a color measurement to compare it with the target colors.

Physical and chemical properties of lychee juice treated with UV treatment and shelf life during cold storage at 4 °C compared to pasteurized sample (85 °C 15 s) were also determined. Kinetics of microbial degradation and antioxidant properties reduction were best-fitted by first-order kinetic model with coefficient of determination (R2) values and rate constants (k) ranging from 0.9759 to 0.9935 and 0.0008–0.1060, respectively. No significant difference was observed in pH, °Brix, %titratable acidity, total flavonoid content and antioxidant activity by DPPH assay. Based on microbial shelf life, UV radiation could extent the shelf life of lychee juice approximately 7 days compared to control sample during storage at 4 °C.

In addition, no significant changes were detected in the investigation of L* b* pH, °Brix, titratable acidity, and turbidity of coconut water treated with UV radiation (p > 0.05). However, UV treatment showed significant effect on a* TP and PPO activity (p ≤ 0.05). TPC of all samples increased while YMC decreased during storage at 4 °C.

Longan juice was inoculated with Escherichia coli and subjected to UV and pasteurization process. UV-149.8 J/cm2, and pasteurized longan juice samples had higher log reduction values of total microbial (2.80 and 3.63), yeast/mold (4.14 and 4.56), and E. coli (2.76 and 4.13) log CFU/mL, respectively, compared to untreated control and other UV treated samples. The first order kinetic model potentially inhibited total microbial count, yeast/molds and E. coli in UV-149.8 J/cm2 sample. pH, total solids, total acidity, and turbidity showed no difference in UV and pasteurized samples. However, color values were affected in pasteurized sample than the UV treatments. Total phenolic content (TPC), total flavonoid content (TFC) and antioxidant (DPPH and FRAP) values were highest in untreated control, followed by the UV-74.88 J/cm2 than that of UV-149.8 J/cm2 and pasteurized samples. Based on the highest bioactivity, UV-74.88 J/cm2 and pasteurized samples were compared for quality changes during 15 days of storage at 4 °C. The selected UV-74.88 J/cm2 sample had higher TPC, TFC, DPPH, and FRAP values than the pasteurized sample up to 12 days of cold storage. Additionally, total plate count and yeast/mold were lowest in UV-74.88 J/cm2 sample in comparison with untreated control. Color values were stable in UV-74.88 J/cm2 sample, compared to pasteurized sample. Pasteurized longan juice showed no growth of yeast/mold during the entire storage period. Therefore, shelf life of UV-74.88 J/cm2 sample was prolonged to 12 days compared to the control sample that became unacceptable after 6 days during storage at 4 °C. UV treatment of longan juice could be considered a promising non-thermal additive free technology for reducing microbial load, improving quality characteristics, and extending shelf life.']"

Topics covered include turbulent and regular motion, dynamical recurrences analogous to the Fermi-Pasta-Ulam phenomena in oscillator chains, and relations between AdS dynamics and nonrelativistic nonlinear Schrödinger equations in harmonic potentials. Special mention is given to the way the classical dynamics of weakly nonlinear strongly resonant systems is illuminated by perturbative considerations within the corresponding quantum theories, in particular, in relation to quantum chaos theory.', 'Quantum resonant systems, integrable and chaotic  2018 IOP Publishing Ltd.Resonant systems emerge as weakly nonlinear approximations to problems with highly resonant linearized perturbations. Examples include nonlinear Schrödinger equations in harmonic potentials and nonlinear dynamics in anti-de Sitter spacetime. The classical dynamics within this class of systems can be very rich, ranging from fully integrable to chaotic as one changes the values of the mode coupling coefficients. Here, we initiate a study of quantum infinite-dimensional resonant systems, which are mathematically a highly special case of two-body interaction Hamiltonians (extensively researched in condensed matter, nuclear and high-energy physics). Despite the complexity of the corresponding classical dynamics, the quantum version turns out to be remarkably simple: the Hamiltonian is block-diagonal in the Fock basis, with all blocks of varying finite sizes. Being solvable in terms of diagonalizing finite numerical matrices, these systems are thus arguably the simplest interacting quantum field theories known to man. We demonstrate how to perform the diagonalization in practice, and study both numerical patterns emerging for the integrable cases, and the spectral statistics, which efficiently distinguishes the special integrable cases from generic (chaotic) points in the parameter space. We discuss a range of potential applications in view of the computational simplicity and dynamical richness of quantum resonant systems.', 'Solvable Cubic Resonant Systems  2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.Weakly nonlinear analysis of resonant PDEs in recent literature has generated a number of resonant systems for slow evolution of the normal mode amplitudes that possess remarkable properties. Despite being infinite-dimensional Hamiltonian systems with cubic nonlinearities in the equations of motion, these resonant systems admit special analytic solutions, which furthermore display periodic perfect energy returns to the initial configurations. Here, we construct a very large class of resonant systems that shares these properties that have so far been seen in specific examples emerging from a few standard equations of mathematical physics (the Gross–Pitaevskii equation, nonlinear wave equations in Anti-de Sitter spacetime). Our analysis provides an additional conserved quantity for all of these systems, which has been previously known for the resonant system of the two-dimensional Gross–Pitaevskii equation, but not for any other cases.']"

Citric acid and tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane were precursors for the one-step synthesis of N-GQDs via in situ hydrothermal methods, providing a high quantum yield of 57.9%. The proposed mechanism uses a fluorescence turn-on approach. Specifically, the fluorescence of N-GQDs is quenched by the incorporation of Ag+ via a photoinduced electron transfer (PET). During the detection step, sulfuric acid converts cyanide (CN-) into hydrogen cyanide (HCN). The Ag+ species on the N-GQD surface then react with the evolved HCN via a coordination bond to form a silver cyanide complex, resulting in the fluorescence emission of the N-GQDs being turned back on. As a result, the fluorescence emission intensity of N-GQDs linearly increased with increasing CN- concentrations in the range of 0.5-25 mg L-1, with a limit of detection (LOD) of 0.08 mg L-1. Notably, the developed sensor has advantages in terms of simplicity, rapidity, low cost, and high selectivity toward CN-.

Co2+ can quench the fluorescence intensity of N,S-GQDs through metal-ligand interaction between the metal ions and the surface functional groups of the fluorescent probe. Furthermore, the addition of Co2+ induces the aggregation of N,S-GQDs, resulting in an enhancement of UV-Visible absorption at 430 nm and color change from colorless to yellow-brown within 3 minutes. The fluorescence intensity of N,S-GQDs can be used to sense Co2+ under the optimal circumstances with a detection limit of 1.25 μM and a working linear range of 0-40 μM. In addition, the sensor probe was applied successfully to the determination of Co2+ in real water samples.

Exposure to Cd (II) can produce serious effects in human organs such as Itai-Itai disease. Therefore, the maximum allowance levels of Cd (II) in drinking water and herbal medicines imposed by the World Health Organization (WHO) are 3 μg L−1 and 300 μg kg−1, respectively. In this work, nitrogen-doped graphene quantum dots (N-GQDs) as a fluorescent sensor for Cd (II) determination was developed in both solution-based and paper-based systems. N-GQDs were synthesized from citric acid (CA) and ethylenediamine (EDA) via the hydrothermal method. The synthesized N-GQDs emitted intense blue fluorescence with a quantum yield (QY) of up to 80%. The functional groups on the surface of N-GQDs measured by FTIR were carboxyl (COO−), hydroxyl (OH−), and amine (NH2) groups, suggesting that they could be bound to Cd (II) for complexation. The fluorescence intensity of N-GQDs was gradually enhanced with the increase of Cd (II) concentration. This phenomenon was proved to result from the fluorescence enhancement (turn-on) based on the chelation enhanced fluorescence (CHEF) mechanism. Under the optimum conditions in the solution-based and paper-based systems, the limits of detection (LODs) were found to be 1.09 and 0.59 μg L−1, respectively. Furthermore, the developed sensors showed relatively high selectivity toward Cd (II) over ten other metal cations and six other anions of different charges. The performance of the sensor in real water and herbal medicine samples exhibited no significant difference as compared to the results of the validation method (ICP-OES). Therefore, the developed sensors can be used as fluorescent sensors for Cd (II) determination with high sensitivity, high selectivity, short incubation time (5 min). As such, the paper-based strategy has excellent promising potential for practical analysis of Cd (II) in water and herbal medicine samples with a trace level of Cd (II) concentrations.']"

Classifier modification is one of the well-known techniques to deal with this particular issue. In this paper, the effective classification model based on an oblique decision tree is enhanced to work with an imbalanced dataset that is called oblique minority condensed decision tree (OMCT). Initially, it selects the best axis-parallel hyperplane based on the decision tree algorithm using the minority entropy of instances within the minority inner fence selection. Then it perturbs this hyperplane along each axis to improve its minority entropy. Finally, it stochastically perturbs this hyperplane to escape the local solution. From the experimental results, OMCT significantly outperforms six state-of-the-art decision tree algorithms that are CART, C4.5, OC1, AE, DCSM and ME on 18 real-world datasets from UCI in term of precision, recall and F1 score. Moreover, the size of a decision tree from OMCT is significantly smaller than others.', 'A random forest with minority condensation and decision trees for class imbalanced problems  2021, World Scientific and Engineering Academy and Society. All rights reserved.Building an effective classifier that could classify a target or class of instances in a dataset from historical data has played an important role in machine learning for a decade. The standard classification algorithm has difficulty generating an appropriate classifier when faced with an imbalanced dataset. In 2019, the efficient splitting measure, minority condensation entropy (MCE) [1] is proposed that could build a decision tree to classify minority instances. The aim of this research is to extend the concept of a random forest to use both decision trees and minority condensation trees. The algorithm will build a minority condensation tree from a bootstrapped dataset maintaining all minorities while it will build a decision tree from a bootstrapped dataset of a balanced dataset. The experimental results on synthetic datasets apparent the results that confirm this proposed algorithm compared with the standard random forest are suitable for dealing with the binary-class imbalanced problem. Furthermore, the experiment on real-world datasets from the UCI repository shows that this proposed algorithm constructs a random forest that outperforms other existing random forest algorithms based on the recall, the precision, the F-measure, and the Geometric mean.', 'Random forest algorithm using quartile-pattern bootstrapping for a class imbalanced problem  2023 ACM.A classification is a problem of identifying the category (or the class) of an unknown-class observation using past historical data. One important issue in a classification is a class imbalanced problem which typically finds in a classification where the proportion of the target class is significantly smaller than others. A traditional classifier normally misclassifies an instance from this target class, called the minority class, as noise due to the small number of instances. Modification of the classification algorithm to handle a class imbalanced problem is a challenging task, especially for a random forest. In the random forest algorithm, the bootstrapping step is used to generate several subsets from a training data by random sampling uniformly with replacement. Most bootstrapping subsets may not even contain instances from the minority class which guarantee decision tree components to misclassify instances from the minority class. A random tree algorithm that needs to generate the bootstrapping subsets for each decision tree must assure the distribution of minority instances. This paper proposes a random forest algorithm using quartile-pattern bootstrapping by leveraging mass-ratio-variance outlier factor and minority condensation decision tree to handle this problem. The mass-ratio-variance outlier factor is a score assigned to each instance that will give a large value to an outlier and give a low value to instances surrounded by other instances in the same class. To evaluate the performance of this proposed algorithm, two synthesized datasets are used in the experiments. The experimental results show significant improvement when a dataset is imbalanced. The performance from the test dataset via F1 with the proposed algorithm is better than the performance from the traditional random forest algorithm.']"

Then, we provide a deep and comprehensive survey of recent and state-of-the-art researches. Finally, we include a discussion section about the advantages and disadvantage of heuristic based and learning based approaches for the readers to explore quickly the performance of the existing algorithms and their limitations. To our knowledge, it is the first comprehensive survey to provide sufficient information about fast CU partitioning on HEVC, JEM, and VVC.', 'Learning-Based Rate Control for High Efficiency Video Coding  2023 by the authors.High efficiency video coding (HEVC) has dramatically enhanced coding efficiency compared to the previous video coding standard, H.264/AVC. However, the existing rate control updates its parameters according to a fixed initialization, which can cause errors in the prediction of bit allocation to each coding tree unit (CTU) in frames. This paper proposes a learning-based mapping method between rate control parameters and video contents to achieve an accurate target bit rate and good video quality. The proposed framework contains two main structural codings, including spatial and temporal coding. We initiate an effective learning-based particle swarm optimization for spatial and temporal coding to determine the optimal parameters at the CTU level. For temporal coding at the picture level, we introduce semantic residual information into the parameter updating process to regulate the bit correctly on the actual picture. Experimental results indicate that the proposed algorithm is effective for HEVC and outperforms the state-of-the-art rate control in the HEVC reference software (HM-16.10) by 0.19 dB on average and up to 0.41 dB for low-delay P coding structure.', 'Fast Coding Unit Encoding Scheme for HEVC Using Genetic Algorithm  2013 IEEE.High efficiency video coding (HEVC) is the newest video codec to increase significantly the coding efficiency of its ancestor H.264/Advance Video Coding with the aids of its new features, such as the quadtree-based coding unit partitioning, a simple deblocking filter, and other advanced coding techniques. However, the HEVC delivers a highly increased computation complexity, which is mainly due to the exhaustive rate distortion optimization search of quadtree-based coding unit partitioning. In this paper, a coding unit partitioning pattern optimization method based on a genetic algorithm is proposed to save the computational complexity of hierarchical quadtree-based coding unit partitioning. The required coding unit partitioning pattern for exhaustive partitioning and the rate distortion cost are efficiently considered as the chromosome and the fitness function of the genetic algorithm, respectively. To reduce the computational time, coding unit partitioning patterns of the key frame are searched and shared to other consecutive frames by taking into account the highly temporal correlation. Our evaluation results show that the proposed method can achieve 62.5% and 16.7% computational complexity reduction on average with a negligible average quality degradation compared with HM16.5 and state-of-the-art support vector machine-based fast algorithm, respectively, under low-delay P configuration with rate control while 64.1% and 15.1% under low-delay configuration with rate control.']"

The snowball and convenience sampling methods were used to select high-level sports teams’ injured athletes returning to sports, and a questionnaire survey was administered, from which 433 valid samples were obtained. Amos v. 26 was used to analyze the data. The results showed that mindfulness has a significant negative effect on competitive state anxiety and burnout, such that after strengthening the mindfulness intervention, athletes’ competitive state anxiety and burnout decreased and regulatory emotional self-efficacy increased. Further, this study indicated that athletes are prone to negative emotions after injury, and among athletes who returned to sports after injury, those with mindfulness interventions reported lower levels of competitive state anxiety and burnout.

Furthermore, 15.34% of respondents (n2 = 96) in 9 out of 10 provinces reported of having consumed bat meat in the past 6 months. Risk factors for bat contact included sex (male) (OR = 1.56, 95% CI 1.09-2.28), educational attainment (lower than secondary school) (OR = 1.45, 95% CI 1.02-2.18), and the consideration of bats as being economically beneficial to the community (OR = 3.18, 95% CI 2.03-4.97), while agriculture-related occupation (OR = 0.54, 95% CI 0.37-0.79), knowledge that it is safe to eat bats (OR = 0.58, 95% CI 0.37-0.93), practice of allowing children to play with bats (OR = 0.65, 95% CI 0.44-0.96), and attitude of feeling safe in areas where bats live (OR = 0.56, 95% CI 0.38-0.86) were statistically significant protective factors against bat contact. Risk factors for bat consumption included sex (male) (OR = 2.48, 95% CI 1.49-4.11) and educational attainment (lower than secondary school) (OR = 2.21, 95% CI 1.27-3.85), while knowledge of whether bats are safe to eat (OR = 0.04, 95% CI 0.01-0.25), knowledge of whether there are laws pertaining to hunting bats for consumption (OR = 0.35, 95% CI 0.18-0.71), and the practice of allowing children to play with bats (OR = 0.51, 95% CI 0.31-0.81) were statistically significant protective factors against bat consumption. Conclusions: This study provides a better understanding of the sociodemographic factors, knowledge, attitudes, perceptions and practices that might influence bat contact and bat consumption behaviors. Information on risk factors can be used for the development of appropriate education and communication interventions to promote proper knowledge, attitudes and practices regarding bats and bat-borne zoonotic diseases in Thailand and other areas in the Southeast Asia region with similar environmental and cultural characteristics.', ""Bats and belief: A sequential qualitative study in Thailand  2020 The AuthorsAttitude; Bat; Belief; Contact; Interface; Perception; Thailand, Conservation; Health sciences; Infectious disease; Religion; Sociology; Public health 2020 The AuthorsBats are wildlife and distribute globally. In Thailand, there are hundreds of bat species in different locations within four regions. However, few motivations and influences for having contact with bats have been documented. This sequential qualitative study was conducted in ten provinces representing the four regions of Thailand from September 2016 to June 2017. The study was designed to obtain information on villagers' attitudes, perceptions, beliefs and cultural contexts in relation to bats. Focus group discussions (FGDs) were conducted with 305 respondents. Of these respondents, 142 (46.6%) reported coming into contact with bats through various activities, such as hunting, eating, cooking, collecting bat guano, cleaning bat feces, and finding carcasses in houses and communities. Villagers called bats by different names in different regions. They reported having been in contact with bats in different ways based on occupations, bat species, bat habitats, attitudes, perceptions, beliefs toward bats, and cultural contexts. Villagers in the northern and northeastern regions reported having regularly eaten bats. In contrast, the respondents in the central region did not eat bats due to local norms, religious beliefs, and regulations. By ethnicity, the Blu and Thai Dum groups reported coming into contact with and eating bats more often than the Thais. Our results provide evidence-based information on the human-bat interface in different regions in Thailand. The results of this qualitative study could be useful for strategic planning of proper education and interventions for bat conservation, bat contact behavior, and risk of bat-borne diseases among villagers in the future.""]"
